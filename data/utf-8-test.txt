There is a new software solution now available that was
specifically designed to bring exactly this type of transparency and
accountability to federal agency spending, called CASCADE™ Performance Based
Budgeting Software. As the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.strategisys.com/software.html"> online video demo </a>
illustrates, CASCADE™ enables large government agencies to develop both
long-term strategic plans and annual performance budgets that show the measurable
goals, strategies, and budget costs on a program-by-program and
manager-by-manager basis. 
 
 With CASCADE™, program managers can also create separate goals
that relate just to Recovery Act funding and indicate that this spending is
distinct from their regular program budget amounts. For a federal agency with hundreds – even thousands – of
managers spread around the country, CASCADE™ can create a single, integrated,
online document with a hierarchical goal structure, showing cascading
performance budgets by program office and location all the way down through the
organization – with the responsible manager identified each step of the way.
And at each step, both the regular program goals, strategies, spending and
results, and the Recovery Act goals, strategies, spending and results, may be
shown for every organization and sub-unit. 
 
 This means that with this new software tool, an agency can
document how each element of Recovery Act spending achieves measurable results
that relate to existing program goals, a summary of the implementation
strategy, and who is responsible for guiding the effort. 
 
 CASCADE™ was designed by John Mercer, the “father of GPRA”
and is the result of a joint development project by Strategisys LLC
(Alexandria, VA) and Integrated Digital Systems, Inc. (Manassas, VA). The software includes many other useful
and unique features that strengthen performance planning, budgeting, management
and accountability in federal agencies, in addition to its ability to bring
performance-related transparency to Recovery Act spending. For more information see <a href="http://www.strategisys.com/software.html">www.strategisys.com/software.html</a>
