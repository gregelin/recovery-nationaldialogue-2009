<h1>
				Online cascading performance budgets and performance reports
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a new software solution now available that was
specifically designed to bring exactly this type of transparency and
accountability to federal agency spending, called CASCADE™ Performance Based
Budgeting Software.&nbsp; As the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.strategisys.com/software.html"><strong>online video demo</strong></a>
illustrates, CASCADE™ enables large government agencies to develop both
long-term strategic plans and annual performance budgets that show the measurable
goals, strategies, and budget costs on a program-by-program and
manager-by-manager basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With CASCADE™, program managers can also create separate goals
that relate just to Recovery Act funding and indicate that this spending is
distinct from their regular program budget amounts.&nbsp; For a federal agency with hundreds – even thousands – of
managers spread around the country, CASCADE™ can create a single, integrated,
online document with a hierarchical goal structure, showing cascading
performance budgets by program office and location all the way down through the
organization – with the responsible manager identified each step of the way.
And at each step, both the regular program goals, strategies, spending and
results, and the Recovery Act goals, strategies, spending and results, may be
shown for every organization and sub-unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that with this new software tool, an agency can
document how each element of Recovery Act spending achieves measurable results
that relate to existing program goals, a summary of the implementation
strategy, and who is responsible for guiding the effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CASCADE™ was designed by John Mercer, the “father of GPRA”
and is the result of a joint development project by Strategisys LLC
(Alexandria, VA) and Integrated Digital Systems, Inc. (Manassas, VA).&nbsp; The software includes many other useful
and unique features that strengthen performance planning, budgeting, management
and accountability in federal agencies, in addition to its ability to bring
performance-related transparency to Recovery Act spending.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information see <a href="http://www.strategisys.com/software.html">www.strategisys.com/software.html</a>
or send an inquiry to <a href="mailto:contact@strategisys.com">contact@strategisys.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>CASCADE™ provides exactly the type of operational
transparency and accountability that President Obama has called for, that
federal managers need, and that the American public deserves.</p>

<p>From the video demo, the software seems pretty comprehensive for performance planning and budgeting, but it wasn't clear whether it would have to be a stand-alone application, or whether it can be integrated with existing budget and financial management products. &nbsp;This would be good to know.</p>

<p>Yes, CASCADE can be set up so that fields in the various data entry forms (performance planning, budgeting, reporting) can be filled in automatically by pulling the data from an agency financial system or database (for example) where appropriate, while other fields are completed manually.</p>

<p>Regarding the opportunity to include text, I want to mention that CASCADE provides fields for written narrative -- such as brief summaries of strategies to achieve the goals and explanations of quarterly and annual results -- but it also provides a document management tool that allows the user to attach complete documents (for more complete details of plans and reports). &nbsp;These documents can be attached to whatever goal or set of goals they relate to, to provide the necessary background info.</p>

<p>There actually are federal managers who have expressed interest in what CASCADE does, and there is increasingly a realization within government agencies that it is more and more important to be able to justify budget requests by documenting clear linkage to plan goals and actual results. &nbsp;The challenge has been to enable that capability throughout a very large organization. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I spent 13 years working on Capitol Hill, both in the House and Senate, and I do share the concern that this type of transparency in spending and performance is not something that Congress has shown much interest in. &nbsp;That's&nbsp;unfortunate, but maybe now with the focus on making sure that Recovery Act spending is well-used, this may begin to change a bit.</p>

<p>One option is to create on the Recovery.gov site links for each department or agency to their cascaded plans and reports on their own sites. &nbsp;If an agency uses the software to create cascading performance budgets and performance reports, with separate identification of ARRA-related goals, spending and results, Recovery.gov could provide links to those documents. &nbsp;Another option is to have agency-generated performance reports also appear on Recovery.gov as a additional presentation.</p>

<p>As was mentioned earlier, because CASCADE is an open application product that can interface with any ODBC-compliant database, establishing linkages between an agency's manager-level performance budgets/reports and a Recovery.gov database should not be difficult.</p>

<p>Yes, this is just the kind of tool that would be helpful.&nbsp; It links performance, with planning, with budget.&nbsp; There are other vendors who also have created software that does this.&nbsp; Results Scorecard from Results management is another.&nbsp; This is what I expected Recovery.org to be.&nbsp; Whether they competitively bid this out, or use open-source developers to create it,&nbsp; this is the kind of thing that is intuitive,&nbsp;easy to grasp&nbsp;and quick to navigate.</p>

<p>To respond to both of the last two comments, we strongly believe that CASCADE helps President Obama do what he has said -- and begun to indicate by his actions -- that he wants to do. &nbsp;And that's in addition to how it supports Recovery Act transparency and accountability. &nbsp;Even before he was elected, he announced that he would set up a SWAT team at the White House and appoint a Chief Performance Officer "to improve results and outcomes for federal government programs while eliminating waste and inefficiency". &nbsp;He said that the "CPO will work with federal agencies to set tough performance targets and hold managers responsible for progress." &nbsp;And he said that he "will experiment with giving government managers the ability to work with their teams to establish goals and give bonuses when those goals are met. &nbsp;These steps will be guided by performance measures and will be transparent and visible to the public and Congress." &nbsp;Our online video demo shows how CASCADE specifically supports all of that.</p>

<p>Some key points from OMB's April 3 memo providing guidance to federal agencies on implementing the ARRA (Recovery Act) should also be noted, as they relate directly to what the CASCADE software enables. &nbsp;In stating what each program's Recovery Program Plan must include, the memo (p. 18) calls for a "description of the program's Recovery Act objectives and relationships with corresponding goals and objectives through ongoing agency programs/activities. &nbsp;Expected public benefits should demonstrate cost-effectiveness and be clearly stated in concise, clear and plain language targeted to an audience with no in-depth knowledge of the program. &nbsp;To the extent possible, Recovery Act goals should be expressed in the same terms as programs' goals in departmental Government Performance and Results Act strategic plans."</p>

<p>The memo then says that there should be &nbsp;measures of "expected quantifiable outcome" and that "the measures currently used to report programs' performance in relationship to these goals . . . should be retained" and that "use of existing measures will allow the public to see the marginal performance impact of Recovery Act investments." &nbsp;The memo goes on to require "Accountability: description of agency program plans for holding managers accountable for achieving recovery Act program goals and improvement actions identified."</p>

<p>CASCADE specifically supports each of these requirements, by allow a program manager to create both regular program goals and separate recovery Act goals on the same planning template, so that the "marginal performance impact of Recovery Act investments" can be identified, using the same types of measures as found in the strategic plan (which the software also develops and then links to the performance budget goals). &nbsp;And the planning templates and performance reports also identifies by name, organization, and location the&nbsp;manager who is responsible for the effort. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I should also add that OMB's guidance memo (p. 38) specifically prohibits agencies from co-mingling Recovery Act and non-Recovery Act funds. &nbsp;One way CASCADE supports this separation is by showing for each program goal -- both &nbsp;"regular" goals and ARRA goals -- whether that goal's funding is from the regular budget or from ARRA funds. &nbsp;This distinction is also maintained in CASCADE's periodic performance and spending reports as provided by managers throughout the year.</p>

<p>Thanks, but no - it was obviously developed well-before the law was passed and the guidance issued. &nbsp;We might like to flatter ourselves and say it was a case of how "great minds think alike," but in truth, what the guidance requires and the software enables is just a logical application of common sense principles about transparency and accountability.</p>

<p>Besides, the OMB guidance deals with a lot more than what CASCADE addresses. &nbsp;But because of how the software was designed, as explained previously, the documents it develops and generates can link to the databases and reports developed elsewhere to comply with many of those other requirements. &nbsp;It's a matter of being able to link a lot of very detailed figures to a specific performance metric or cost figure in a performance budget.</p>

<p>One way to think of the software is as providing the up-front performance context for a lot of other data on Recovery Act spending that has to be compiled elsewhere. &nbsp;It shows managers, citizens, Congress, etc. what that&nbsp;spending&nbsp;is all about, in understandable terms. &nbsp;Here's the goal, here's the strategy, here's the cost, here's what was achieved, here's what was spent -- and here's the location and here's who is responsible. &nbsp;Of course, it does the same thing for non-ARRA spending too.</p>

<p>It really depends on what the agencies and the Recovery.gov website want. &nbsp;Presumably, a federal agency would use CASCADE to develop a complete set of cascading performance budgets (actually one large budget made up of many "mini" PBs) -- as well as the related strategic plan -- going all the way down to the first-line supervisors. &nbsp;The agency itself would have access to this complete set. &nbsp;Then it might post online the cascading performance budgets (and strategic plan) just down to a certain level. &nbsp;However, the Recovery Board might call for more detail, or it might not. &nbsp;But remember, they will probably be tracking and showing this information on Recovery.gov at the individual project level anyway. &nbsp;OMB seems to want it very granular. &nbsp;It's a question of also relating that public information to the CASCADE format in a performance budget, and how much of that is shown online. &nbsp;Maybe even the local field office of the federal agency will show its performance budget, with ARRA-funded projects included. &nbsp;It depends on what the agency and OMB and the Recovery Board want to do.</p>

<p>I'm not sure we know yet just how all of this will play out, regarding level of detail, managerial accountability, etc. &nbsp;The Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board and OMB will probably continue to roll out new requirements and processes for a while as implementation issues come up. &nbsp;Our only point here is that whatever level of transparency and accountability is required -- and this includes for non-ARRA funds too -- CASCADE is a great enabler.</p>

<p>The question about showing manager-specific information raises another issue. &nbsp;As the video demo shows, a manager creates a "section" of an agency-wide strategic plan by first getting a higher-level goal cascaded to him/her and then creating one or more supporting goals, with strategies, and then cascading that on to subordinate managers. &nbsp;But if a manager gets several different goals cascaded to him/her, then the supporting goals they create might appear in different places in the strategic plan (i.e., each under a different higher-level goal). &nbsp;This would be the same situation in a cascaded performance budget, which also shows costs. &nbsp;So setting aside the issue of how much of this is shown publicly online, it still raises the question of how to find out what a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;manager is responsible for in an entire strategic plan or performance budget. &nbsp;The CASCADE software makes this very easy to do, by including a feature called "Managerial Accountability Plans" -- which shows a list of all of the tool's users, and with one click on a user's name, brings together into one&nbsp;Managerial&nbsp;Accountability Plan all of the various strategic plan or performance budget sections (goals, strategies, costs, etc.) that apply just to that one manager. &nbsp;This includes both ARRA-related&nbsp;and non-ARRA-related information.</p>

<p>The software may not do that automatically in quite the
manner you describe, though it can flag where performance has fallen short of
the goal, which can then be the basis for generating reports the agency needs
by using a standard reporting tool like Crystal Reports.&nbsp; In CASCADE, both periodic (i.e.,
quarterly) and annual results compared with targets are entered, and then a
green-yellow-red indicator is set to show status.&nbsp; For example, for a particular goal coming within 10% of
target might be good enough for a yellow status, rather than red, while for
another goal the only choices may be just red or green.&nbsp; And in every case, there is a text
field for the manager to enter an explanation.&nbsp; In the case of a federal agency, the law (the Government
Performance and Results Act of 1993 – GPRA) requires an explanation wherever a
goal is not met.&nbsp; So the shortfall
and reason is flagged, but not automatically sent to anyone – the immediate
superior sees this information during the next budget development cycle –
although such a capability can be easily added as described.&nbsp; This is one reason CASCADE was
developed as an ODBC-compliant, open application product – is to enable it to link
to other existing tools and databases, such as one that can do what you describe. &nbsp;And obviously, we can work with any customer to make sure that the desired reports are generated from the CASCADE database, based on their particular needs.</p>

<p>Since this discussion is supposed to be about improving the Recovery.gov website, the best answer about whether to develop one large versus several smaller budgets may be that it depends on how an agency's use of CASCADE would interface with the databases and linkages on Recovery.gov. &nbsp;The idea would be go start on Recovery.gov and trace an ARRA item over to an agency performance budget, and then perhaps over to the strategic plan that is presumably the original of the long-term goals that should drive development of ARRA spending outcomes (i.e.,measurable goals for results). &nbsp;That is how the software being used by an agency can help put ARRA spending into a results-oriented context, and show that the results(planned and actual) do clearly support the strategic and annual goals of the agency.</p>

<p>With that thought about relating to the Recovery.gov website in mind, the agency also needs to consider that how it structures its strategic plan (as developed with CASCADE) will affect how it structures its performance budget(s). &nbsp;This is because in creating a performance budget, the software first asks whether you want that PB to be based on a particular strategic plan, or on a previous year's PB, or whether you want to develop a new PB from scratch. &nbsp;So if a department wants its bureaus to develop individual performance budgets, rather than cascading one down from the departmental goals, then it should probably have each bureau create a bureau-specific strategic plan first. &nbsp;But as mentioned above, if the Recovery.gov site is going to be linked to these plans and budgets, the agency may want to map those linkages first. &nbsp;So Recovery.gov has a role to play in planning this.</p>

<p>The Recovery.gov website will need links and not only to federal agency sites, but probably to those of other governments spending ARRA funds. &nbsp;CASCADE was designed to be usable by any large governmental organization, including state governments. &nbsp;There are actually two very similar versions, with one being specifically for federal agencies -- but the difference in the two is just in some of the embedded guidance. &nbsp;The video demo is relevant to any user. &nbsp;</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Tracking through Google Earth and web cam
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>An opportunity exists to expand Recovery.gov into a site that enables citizens to track recovery projects and how their money is being spent, and does so in an engaging way that encourages citizen participation, and hopefully rallies consumer confidence and enthusiasm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This idea involves posting ARRA stimulus projects on Google Earth so that people can sort and view projects by location, size or type.&nbsp; They could then ‘fly’ to the project location and see a graphic simulation of the project; read about the project (goals, costs, jobs created, timelines, org charts, project plans) and track progress visually through Earthcam or project specific web camera; meet the project manager and get updates; watch people working; find out if jobs are available; get links to job training programs etc.&nbsp; Scientific research projects could ‘fly’ people into a lab where the scientist would present his/her thesis, discuss the research and status of the research, and ultimately present the results.&nbsp; Clean energy projects could tour entrepreneurial companies engaged in solar, wind, clean coal, algae, electric cars – generating enthusiasm for what’s coming, and possibly even investment interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This vision obviously involves Google Earth, Recovery.gov, Earthcam or web camera network, and possibly the engagement of an army of citizen volunteers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementation would involve the addition of a line item in the communications segment of every project plan.&nbsp; The manager would submit basic project information related to location, costs, jobs, project plan, org chart for posting on the Google Earth ‘Recovery’ layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A working group would categorize projects as they are approved, and recommend how they should be presented.&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category A - important, high visibility projects such as infrastructure projects - light rail, highways and bridges, energy projects – smart grid and wind farms, and environmental restoration are longer term and lend themselves to graphic simulation, and on-site video and tracking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category B - large, high priority projects such as 21<sup>st</sup> century classrooms, and computerized health records are not solely geographic, and don’t lend themselves to weekly tracking but do lend themselves to visual example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category C - Big ideas for multiple small projects that create many jobs and should be implemented everywhere such as home weatherization, and Infrastructure repairs and upgrades, would show a generalized how to video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category D - Major Research and Development programs that lend themselves educational video, or tours of innovative, entrepreneurial companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category E - Equipment purchases that can be shown by photo record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category F - Training and jobs programs could be plotted locally, but also linked to like projects nationwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All projects would be posted on Google Earth in a special Recovery.gov layer and identified by&nbsp;&nbsp; placemarks – state or agency designated ARRA logo. Each site would be linked to the required contracts, invoices, payroll data etc. on their respective state, and agency sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain key projects could be assigned to a group of creative and technical professionals who would develop additional 3D SketchUps to simulate e.g. light rail routes, new bridges, green buildings.&nbsp; The group could even encourage submissions from job applicants as part of an ‘Apprenticeship’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Citizen volunteers could be engaged to conduct interviews with project managers, take videos, set up web cams, and monitor and promote interest in projects locally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Links existing technology programs and networks to turn Recovery.gov into a picture window through which citizens can view stimulus projects and monitor the expenditure and use of recovery funds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leverages technology to create jobs and volunteer opportunities, and catalyzes active citizenship and private public sector partnerships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creates a virtual 21<sup>st</sup> Century Classroom that uses technology and geography to expose and educate people about the ‘work’ of the nation, and links them to the resources they’ll need to participate.</p>

<p>This is obviously a popular idea based on the many excellent comments.&nbsp; One alternative, particularly in line with the citizen participation portion of the idea and comments, would be to make the data readily available in a format people could use for mashups or to develop other apps with Google Earth. Would that meet the objective here?</p>

<p>OK. I'm guilty of commenting first, then reading what others had to say . . .&nbsp; and I'm not at all "wedded" to Google Earth - you could use a simple search tool, ala MapQuest, to let a citizen put in their address and find out what projects are "visible" in their area - the key work is VISIBLE - seeing, not just reading.&nbsp; We are a 21st century population, and need to see what projects are underway, in addition to reading about them.</p>

<p>I like the concept but wonder how realistic it is to think it could be done without driving up costs and creating effeciency challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;How much would the average&nbsp;bid need to be increased to pay for a project manager to enter all&nbsp;the required data?&nbsp;&nbsp; Are building plans, timelines and org charts the property of the engineering/ construction&nbsp;firm that provides a competitve advantage over the other firms who were not chosen for the project?&nbsp; Would publishling those plans put them at a competitive disadvantage for the next bid or would these requirements make potential firms&nbsp;less likely to bid?&nbsp; (I understand that&nbsp;not bidding is their choice but&nbsp;don't we&nbsp;want&nbsp;as many competitive bids as possible?)&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, what about security issues with publishing technical plans for an airport or alternative energy plant?&nbsp; I do like the idea though of being able&nbsp;to see&nbsp;where projects are in progress and what they consist of but making firms publish all that info&nbsp;seems too costly to me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A virtual database of decisions, progress, and anticipated outcome would be of great benefit to the general public. A user friendly application such as Google Earth would have the resources available to make such important information available, with the tools necessary to understand the process taking place. Ideas such as this are instrumental in grasping such an enormous undertaking. Well done!</p>

<p>The visualization concept is fantanstic and almost unarguable.&nbsp; What I think is missing is 1) The process and due diligence that is required to&nbsp;assure projects are being reported truthfully and accurately and 2) The process that will take our current antiquated construction processes to the transparency and efficiency levels of the 21st Century.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Add Mapping and Geographic Analysis to Recovery.gov
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Mapping and Geographic Analysis capabilities would enable Recovery.gov to provide a “full picture” of stimulus spending as envisioned by American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maps supported by a Geographic Information System (GIS) would enable people to see, understand, evaluate, and give feedback on government decisions. They would show where ARRA spending is actually taking place and enable evaluation of intended outcomes of investments in local communities. This would require data about the location of investment spending as well as analysis capabilities that link stimulus funding to socio-economic and demographic data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery.gov should provide information and interpretive maps as well as underlying data and online tools for working with this data. &nbsp;The underlying GIS needs to be based on open standards (i.e., IT, Web and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards) to enable citizens and government to utilize the broadest possible geospatial analytic and mapping capabilities to track and understand ARRA stimulus spending and outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Specifically</strong>, we recommend the following to enhance transparency:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to select and view maps of the data provided by government agencies</strong>— This capability would be supported by an underlying Recovery.gov geographic information system, enabling the creation, storage, and maintenance of data, the database, and a library of maps showing basic ARRA fund distribution and status. These data would be directly supplied by government agencies.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to analyze performance spatially</strong>— The site should support an easy-to-use capability for geographic data analysis and visualization. Recovery.gov should be able to integrate, analyze, and display location-related information from various sources including Internet geospatial Web services encompassing spending information and performance measurement data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to create and share maps</strong>— This capability would allow citizens to easily and dynamically create maps of any recovery data at any scale: national, regional, local, neighborhoods, etc. This capability would support posting, discovery, and viewing of citizen-created maps. These maps should also support various types of analysis (i.e., time, project, and performance measurement). The site would support creation of standard maps by anyone using map templates. This would allow the same geographic data to be reviewed over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to contribute comments</strong>— This capability would enable citizens to submit comments, photos, and other information about projects (i.e., schedules, performance and benefits, problems, etc.) linked to the maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to summarize spending and other data by geographic areas</strong>— Citizens should be able to summarize projects and expenditure data by zip codes, counties, congressional districts, states, or other user-defined geographic areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to download data and project information</strong>— Recovery.gov should support the ability of citizens to download any dataset for specific geographic locations for use and analysis using their own analysis and mapping tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other recommendations:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable Recovery.gov administrators to perform integration and quality assurance of data from multiple sources</strong>— Recovery.gov will integrate an enormous amount of federal and state information. This information will need to be retrieved and brought together with systematic workflows that ensure quality as well as timely dissemination. We encourage the use of proven professional GIS technology and talent for the design and management of this system.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Require ARRA fund recipients to report specific geographic locations of all projects and expenditures</strong>— The government should specify that all reporting agencies provide x,y location data to support the Recovery.gov data model/format and enable geography-based analysis and mapping.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Employ phased implementation approach</strong>— We recommend a phased approach for implementation of GIS for Recovery.gov. This would involve a basic capability implemented in a few months with improvements after 6 months, and a full IT system deployment in 12-18 months.&nbsp; Early phases would involve integration and services whereas later phases would involve directly connecting with a distributed data and reporting system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the capabilities we recommend are already implemented on a number of state Web sites including</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State of Maryland <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mdimap.com/statestat/">StateStat</a></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State of Oregon <a class="external-link" href="http://www.oregon.gov/recovery/StimulusReporting/index.shtml">Tracking the Dollars</a></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State of Washington <a class="external-link" href="http://www.recovery.wa.gov/map/default.asp#">Stimulus Reporting Map</a></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the other capabilities discussed here have been implemented in non-stimulus related applications by organizations across the country across the web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Maps communicate. Spatial analysis reveals insights and understanding. GIS provides the platform for both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve transparency and accountability you must be able to understand the raw data and analyze it in context with other relevant data. Using GIS to spatially enable, manage and analyze the stimulus data allows us to go beyond massive tables of data and simple dots on maps to begin to measure performance and evaluate accountability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make ARRA funds relevant to citizens you need to keep it local. To spatially analyze investment activities and their impact in the community and show it on a map requires a robust GIS foundation.</p>

<p>This is a great idea.&nbsp; Visualizing and tracking investments using Internet-based maps is a powerful way to increase citizen transparency and government accountability.&nbsp; Use of GIS technology will provide analytical tools so multiple factors affecting investments and job creation can be seen and clearly understood.&nbsp; To take advantage of the power of visualization and spatial analysis requires reporting of accurate locations of the place of performance of projects and investments. &nbsp;&nbsp;OMB should clearly require recipient organizations to report the location of where Recovery funds are being spent.</p>

<p>Cheers and agreement with tbuckley and Billfgreer about the importance of effective map visualization and front-end tools for the public to use.&nbsp; Using maps to add transparency and information accessibility to Recovery.gov is quite a different design scope than front-end visualization and tools in apps designed for GIS professionals to use.&nbsp; A good&nbsp;app developer knows their audience.</p>

<p>As a US resident, I applaud our government's (and this new administration's) proactive drive to improve transparency, particularly in this&nbsp;program which&nbsp;has unprecedented depth and breadth.&nbsp; Personally, I expect and demand that this information be presented in the most consumable and understandable way possible.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I want more than just a slick web front end and dots telling me what went where and when. &nbsp; Sure, those who spend the funds need to report it, but&nbsp;taxpayers will&nbsp;want to know more than just what the tax spenders&nbsp;have to&nbsp;say.&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect more than just grabbing a few layers and databases from a few different&nbsp;public sources and mashing them together into a single map.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taxpayers will want some common ways&nbsp;to analyze the sum of the parts, to&nbsp;explore the&nbsp;"why's",&nbsp;analysis of what's working and what isn't compared to&nbsp;other things, temporal analysis, munging against&nbsp;their own&nbsp;data if&nbsp;they have it, processing and analysis against other political, demographic, topographic, etc. datasets, and so forth.&nbsp; They may want to ask their *own* questions of the data and&nbsp;draw their own conclusions; not just what's being fed to them.&nbsp; That's what GIS brings&nbsp;on the processing end.</p>

<p>But in the end--absolutely--how GIS can be used to process and analyze&nbsp;the data, and the design of the tools/presentation of those maps being made accessible to the public are two different things.&nbsp; I'm already seeing lots of good examples of map visualization on this thread and others.&nbsp; What a great forum this has been so far.</p>

<p>Organizing, tracking and presenting the data by location makes sense for everyone.&nbsp; GIS, the digital system behind the maps we see on on the Internet today, provides a robust IT framework, organized by physical location, capable of storing the many rich media types needed to communicate powerfully with the public. It is easy for administrators to secure, understand and manage.&nbsp; It can scale to deliver a rich media experience to many,
many people of many, many different backgrounds, perhaps in different
languages, at once.&nbsp;&nbsp; GIS fits the key user requirements, the user being all of us -- it supports the delivery to all types of home, office, vehicle and mobile device locations of that rich, browser based, Web 2.0 experience to a public increasingly familiar with using the Web not only with their PCs, and HDTVs, but with mobile devices.&nbsp; The delivery of the recovery experience to America will need to encompass modes of media computing ranging from handheld to far-view models.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The issue with taking a GIS centric approach with recovery.gov is that GIS was never built to be democratized tot he public.&nbsp; GIS is built around the concept that trained professional operate tools to produce mapping and analysis that can then viewed by the public in a very currated way.&nbsp; How many training classes does ESRI and other GIS vendors offer to provide the traiing to operate their tools to create maps and data analysis?&nbsp;</p>

<p>For starters a number of people are separating GIS (i.e. ESRI, AutoDesk, Idrisi) from open source visualizations.&nbsp; All of these are GIS.&nbsp; Some are more robust and some are more simplified than others, but they are all GIS.&nbsp; Once we come to concensus that all of these applications are trying to get geographic information into the hands of the users (i.e. GIS professionals, the government, the public), then we can talk about what is the best way to do that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>GIS is a great way to provide context sensitive data to users. I would also anticipate users wanting a simplified interface that might provide a dashboard that combines a business intelligence layer with GIS. This would enhance the value of the GIS delivered information by providing additional analysis capability and could also simplify the user experience. There are some interesting joint implmentations of ESRI and IBM Cognos to support existing Federal and state programs. These should be explored .</p>

<p>The fact is that recovery.gov is looking to empower the public in order to achieve transparency. Some great technology (previously noted) has been created that challenges traditional GIS that must be considered. Most glaring problem: The learning curve for your traditional applications is steep, which must be accounted for when talking about usability for the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The user interface is not going to be GIS - there seems to be some confusion here.&nbsp; But not to IT developers - perhaps 80% of any given project budget is directly or indirectly GUI related, rendering and exposing the functionality as robustly yet transparently as we can.&nbsp; GIS is simply the system behind the scenes, the framework, the enabler - the public will never see it, just like they don't see what goes into television or movie or theater or music production.

<p>I agree that GIS is great, and ESRI is at the top of my list.&nbsp; However, as another commenter said - GIS is intended to be used by GIS-trained analysts, not end users.&nbsp; The analysts' products could then be presented to different audiences (e.g., John Q. Public).</p>

<p>But no GIS technology, trained analyst, and end-user will gain value from this capability unless they are all operating from a shared understanding of what the GIS/CAD reports mean.&nbsp; If there is no shared terminolgy that captures the semantics (meaning in context)&nbsp;of the participants, then no consistent data structures will be available, so no consistent geographic representation by GIS technology will be possible.</p>

<p>I would like to see an input/output model of the&nbsp;economy similar to the large&nbsp;poster Scientific American magazine used to publish annually--that was a matrix of the 1000 largest companies, arranged&nbsp;along X- and Y- axes, where the intersection of a row and a column contained a numerical value reflecting the effect of one company on another. It could include&nbsp;an&nbsp;analysis of the local effects, for example&nbsp;the number of jobs this might create in some community.&nbsp; I don't think those&nbsp;posters have&nbsp;been published&nbsp;for&nbsp;a couple of decades,&nbsp;but the model could be revisited for both public and private sector activity and extended by adding a geospatial component.&nbsp; In the application, the value of a cell in that spreadsheet would&nbsp;be distributed spatially across&nbsp;the locations of&nbsp;multiple locations (physical&nbsp;plants and facilities) associated with that single value.&nbsp;Developing such an application might&nbsp;be a daunting chore (perhaps a continuing governmental or NGO&nbsp;function, on the part of&nbsp;someone like the CBO or Brookings), but I think it is doable. This&nbsp;capability would be not just for purposes of disclosure and transparency, but should&nbsp;also be&nbsp;useful as a planning tool for local government and&nbsp;private-sector&nbsp;manufacturing and services.

<p>GIS and Remote Sensing&nbsp;are already being utilized to monitor a wide variety of projects worldwide.&nbsp; Transparency is the driving factor behind most, if not all, of these monitoring programs.&nbsp; As ARRA funds are spent, the public requires a way to visualize the effect of stimulus spending without having to read through volumes of reports.&nbsp; Spatial context is a powerful tool in educating and getting buy-in from stakeholders at all levels.&nbsp; GIS will allow stimulus data to go well beyond showcasing progress and will quickly become the backbone of the planning and monitoring of ARRA projects.</p>

<p>Secondly, I applaud ESRI's suggestion as not only obvious, but logical.&nbsp; It implies&nbsp;the creation of a web-based mapping service, which will give all citizens the opportunity to navigate to a website and view this dynamic data at any opportunity, as well as the capability to drill-down to local-level geography from the national map.&nbsp; Most ArcIMS maps that I have used have been very easy to use, and can provide for HTML links, printable PDFs, and a myriad of other features to the public.&nbsp; I personally do not suggest employing Google Maps because it is not as customizable as a dedicated web mapping service, and&nbsp;I don't believe&nbsp;that the data should be decentralized outside of federal, state and local government &nbsp;(see <a href="http://recovery.ny.gov/">recovery.ny.gov</a> for an example).&nbsp;</p>

<h1>
				Count ACTUAL jobs created or retained with CertiClear Job Counter
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><strong>CertiClear Job Counter</strong> [<a class="external-link" href="http://jobcounter.certiclear.com">http://jobcounter.certiclear.com]</a> is a “shovel ready,” job counting application that is easy-to-use, easy-to-integrate into existing software and inexpensive. Agencies subscribe to the hosted service with a low-cost fee and user license and no cost need be passed on to the prime or sub-recipients. If requested, the Software may be installed behind firewalls. Agencies have real time views of information and seamless reporting capabilities.<br /><br />The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends continuing “efforts to identify methodologies that can be used to determine jobs created and retained from projects funded by the Recovery Act.” [<a class="external-link" href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-580">http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-580</a>]<br /><br />Job Counter assures real people in real jobs are being counted accurately, preventing inaccurate “guesstimates” by recipients, or the use of “phantom” employees by fraudulent businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />CertiClear Job Counter is an IT solution that should be required by Recovery.gov and adopted by agencies to:<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide consistent data collection <br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reduce fraud, waste and abuse <br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide greater transparency as to actual jobs created and retained</p>
<p>CertiClear (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.certiclear.com/">http://www.certiclear.com/)</a> modified existing patent-pending technology to build Job Counter because&nbsp; government agencies have the same goals as taxpayers: to assure transparency and accountability and avoid fraud, waste and abuse of Recovery funds.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>According to an April 23rd letter from Vice President Biden to Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will be issuing updated guidance in early May to address concerns of state and local officials. One of those areas:<br /><em>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A standard procedure for recipients to calculate jobs created</em><br /><br />Job Counter provides the “standard procedure” by gathering the data elements identified in the OMB guidance document of April 3, 2009 (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/memoranda_fy2009/m09-15.pdf">M-09-10</a>).&nbsp; Recipients can begin today meeting all the Reporting Requirements (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.smartpdf.com/register/2009/Mar/31/14639A.pdf">Section 1512 of the Recovery Act</a>) of the Interim FAR Rules, which have data reporting requirements retroactive to March 31, 2009. Job Counter collects all of the required data elements through simple uploads or easy online forms, limiting the administrative burden on recipients.<br /><br />Job Counter will help reduce fraud, waste and abuse because it provides for a level of assurance that recipients are hiring real people. The jobs data collected is auditable information to assure validity, but not of a confidential nature. At no time is private information reported or confidentiality breached.<br /><br /></p>

<p>It is very important for the recipients of Recovery funding to report the real numbers of jobs created or retained.&nbsp; The public will not and should not accept "estimates."&nbsp; Certiclears Job Counter software is right on target because it counts real jobs and makes the results transparent.&nbsp; Thank you for the opportunity to comment.</p>

<p>My only concern here is that there WILL need to be some level of estimation of job creation in cases where the funding is designed to increase demand, which, in turn drives job creation. In the cases where recovery funds *can* be tied directly to job creation, this sounds like a great idea (whether it's this specific application or another mechanism I can't say -- I'm assuming we'll proceed with caution on any "use this tool" idea that was clearly submitted by the vendor; I'm not saying that makes it a bad idea -- just that it will need a rigorous evaluation to validate that it's the right tool).</p>

<p>Accurate counting of jobs is crucial in measuring the efficacy of the Recovery Act and combatting fraud. The Job Counter software provides a transparent, straigthforward solution to help achieve those goals and should certainly be reviewed by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board.</p>

<p>Funding of the stimulus was based on jobs, therefore counting the jobs can also help funnel the investments into the right projects. Funding for projects should be released in phases. As each milestone is met, then the next phase of sponsorship can ensue.</p>

<p>As the CertiClear representative, I wanted to respond to a few of the comments raised.&nbsp; First, Job Counter captures the date of hire (DOH) of the employee and the AWARD DATE of the stimulus funds.&nbsp;&nbsp; A job is counted as "retained" when the DOH is prior to the award date and a job is "created" when the DOH is after the award date.&nbsp; One of the benefits of a SaaS system is we can modify it if OMB provides guidance that differs from our definition.&nbsp; We welcome other suggestions and comments about defining a job created or retained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Federal government spending from the top down through state appropriation bills&nbsp;is a highly inefficient process. It will be no different with this stimulus package.

<p>I think it a capital idea (no pun intended)&nbsp;to count actual jobs retained or created vs. estimates. The logic however put forth as to how the retained and created jobs are counted is pretty simplistic. Actual job retention or creation is far more complex than the comparison of&nbsp; Date Of Hire (DOH)&nbsp;and award date as below.</p>

<p>It's fairly obvious that this tool could not possibly capture the ripple effects of EVERY job created but it does provide for a baseline count of the jobs directly supported by the stimulus contracts.</p>

<p>If the federal agencies are not using this tool, what alternative are they using to measure this important metric?&nbsp; Estimates (guesses)???&nbsp;&nbsp; I would think that insufficient reporting and oversight would make these contracts ripe for fraud and perhaps that is a secondary value of this tool. It can help prevent fraud by forcing businesses to report actual data rather than just an accumulated count of jobs.</p>

<p>Provide Enterprise Resource Planning Solutions as suggested by HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&amp;R) report on <a class="external-link" href="http://www.huduser.org/publications/manufhsg/ircs.html">Industrializing the Residential Construction Site</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Adopting the principles cited in HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&amp;R) report on <a class="external-link" href="http://www.huduser.org/publications/manufhsg/ircs.html"><u>Industrializing the Residential Construction Site</u></a>&nbsp;will&nbsp;empower local&nbsp;Community Development Corporations (CDCs) to quickly scale their operations with transparncy and accountability.&nbsp; A significant portion of the ARRA has been set aside for housing restoration and weatherization overwhelming local housing agencies. An open source, many-to-many, Web 2.0&nbsp;knowledge base provides a data sharing relationship between the CDCs across the country.</p>
<p>An innovative solution, <a class="external-link" href="http://www.rebuildingmanagement.com">RebuildingManagement.com</a>&nbsp;<br />originally developed to&nbsp;empower Long Term Recovery Organizations (LTROs) provide construction management services to displaced Hurricane Katrina homeowners is already in existence and ready to be deployed, . Nationwide deployment could be expedited through FEMA's Volunteer Agency Liason (VAL) force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious benefit of empowering local&nbsp;CDCs to&nbsp;meet the current need, long term distater recovery preparedness would simultaneously take place by pre-establishing LTROs for future emergency response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem is how to best manage these weatherization jobs.&nbsp; It is my understanding that the Federal government has or intends to fund the states with the money to launch this nationwide weatherization program.&nbsp; The states apparently delegate to local communities who are not prepared to administer these jobs without risking mismanagement and deliberate fraud.&nbsp; So apparently the money just sits there and nothing gets done.&nbsp; Gridlock occurs because the CDCs or local units in charge of implementing the weatherization program are afraid to do so.</p>

<p>A&nbsp;ERP such as this could give these CDCs the important management tool to coordinate this work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know because I've checked their product out thoroughly and it is readily apparent that not only will the program provide complete transparency, it is also apparent that the management team behind this ERP is construction savvy.&nbsp; In other words, I came away with the impression these guys know what they are doing.&nbsp; But, I'm also biased.&nbsp; Let me explain.</p>

<p>I was approached by Rebuilding Management a couple of years ago to develop a business incubation program that would target the average trade contractor.&nbsp; The goal was to provide training, support and additional business managment tools that would not only keep these contractors honest, it would also keep them productive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My program, TradeCubate, does just that.&nbsp; We focus on educating the trade contractor on the best way to run a construction business and we use third party vendors that make sure things that normally get a business in trouble doesn't happen here.&nbsp; Correct payroll processing, paying payroll taxes, and obtaining business insurance are just some areas where the typical trade contractor is lax.&nbsp;HRM and HRMD are other areas that are important.&nbsp;Davis-Bacon compliance is just another area where our expertise can benefit the trade contractor and the local community.&nbsp; I will stop with the hype now and make my point.</p>

<p>If you think about it, the world of construction has been plagued with three huge problems:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;The construction industry is&nbsp;mired in the same decades-old management, tracking, and reporting processes and doesn't&nbsp;seem to have an incentive to move out of them, 2) the industry is known for poor and slow communications of solutions, ideas, methods,&nbsp;new products, and problems (i.e.&nbsp;defective drywall) across the industry, and 3) there has been absolutely&nbsp;NO focus on restoring homes versus building new construction... all critical issues for the projects this administration is targetting.</p>

<p>Another, less obvious benefit for deploying communitee wide ERP solutions would be to the struggling US Auto industry.&nbsp; The aggregate work load forcasting would provide valuable equipment needs forcasting.&nbsp; These small growing&nbsp;businesses will need trucks, vans, insulation equipment as well as ladders and other small tools.</p>

<p>By empowering CDCs to provide construction management and oversight and using online direct deposit contractor payments, cash strapped small contractors may be able to avoid the need for an operating line of credit.&nbsp; This will relieve the pressure on banking system and allow stimulus dollars to flow directly to the workers.&nbsp; Manufacturers at all levels would be able to scale their inventories to meet actual market demand.</p>

<p>Big "connected" general contractors would be at a disadvantage which allows more stimulus dollars to get into the hands of the working mans hands rather the corporate bonuses.&nbsp; The CDCs become the dispersers of the funds which would lessen the power that the banking industry has held over this capital intensive industry.</p>

<p>One of the first things I observed at this specific ERP was how well it addressed commonalities between business.&nbsp; For example, if any business no matter what industry, can break their process down into tasks, then this system is applicable.&nbsp; If any industry is concerned about where the money is being spent, then this ERP is applicable.&nbsp; In a typical ERP, the problems are usually found in taking realtime data and generating meaningful interpretations of that data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I can the owner of Rebuilding Management to chime in, I think he will recall that during our initial meetings, I suggested that he might consider repurposing his ERP to apply to other industries because at the time, I saw where his transparent model could make any industry more profitable and more productive.&nbsp; Just my two cents worth!</p>

Strategic partnering between TradeCubate and AMS Staff Leasing has brought in an industry leader into the fold to provide these services as part of the TradeCubate package(coupled with Rebuilding Management).&nbsp; Not only does TradeCubate offer a variety of ways to advise/train/instruct/etc the trade contractor, but brings responsibility and accountability to taking care of the employees.&nbsp; No more will an employee finish his or her work week only to find his employer skipped town with the paycheck.&nbsp; Staff Leasing will not allow it.&nbsp; Same is to be said for payroll reporting and the handling of worker's compensation claims.&nbsp; The employee comes first in the staff leasing model.&nbsp; Something that is often lacking in areas after a disaster.
<br />
<br />
The level of accountability in a Staff Leasing scenario is tremendous.&nbsp; When 100% of the payroll is visible and reported, that means one of the largest single portions of a construction project is visible, which has a tendency to keep everyone using the program honest.&nbsp; Honesty, again something often lacking in post-disaster areas.
<br />
<br />
The alliance between Rebuilding Management and TradeCubate is ideal.&nbsp; One complimenting the other.&nbsp; TradeCubate brings many facets of contractor management as well as incubation to the table, and by partnering with&nbsp;AMS Staff Leasing, completely handles the employees ranging from individuals on a work site, to entire contracting companies working on these projects.

<p>This is not the answer for managing the infrastructure needs of the country.

<p>Its ready to go... its transparent...its in real time... it brings in&nbsp;the local community, yet has ability to be used nationwide.&nbsp; Of those mentioned, in my opinion, the prevention or discouragement of fraud is prehaps one of the most important.&nbsp; Big money is involved; we&nbsp;have to be mindful as to its use.&nbsp;&nbsp;The taxpayers deserve no less.&nbsp; This solution seems to address those concerns.</p>

<p>Perhaps RebuildingManagement LLC would like to release their software under the Affero GPL software license and reorient themselves towards supporting all the various government entities who would make use of such software.

Weex,
<p>You have made an interesting suggestion.&nbsp; If the open accessability to the "code" held as much value as the disciplined process management knowledge base that the structured data&nbsp;offers, then your idea&nbsp;would have more merit. Opening the code up to software programers who are inexperienced in construction would be the equivalent of handing a power saw to a toddler to play with. A very dangerous combination indeed.</p>

<p>Interesting, a system that can track product, proformance of the job, cost by the consumer.&nbsp; Looks like 100% control.

<h1>
				Add National Online Mapping to Recovery.gov
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<strong>Add National Online Mapping to Recovery.gov</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advent of online data and mapping, provides Recovery.gov (and the federal government itself) with a unique opportunity to take advantage of platforms that are fast, efficient, cost effective and accessible. Just under a year ago, we launched a national data warehouse and mapping tool – <a class="external-link" href="http://www.policymap.com/">http://www.policymap.com/</a> – to provide users with online access to data, maps, tables and reports in a sophisticated yet easy to use web platform. Based on that experience, we have some thoughts and examples on what the Recovery.gov data and mapping application should provide to the public so that the result is not just a high-quality visual display of information, but an underlying searchable database of information for the government and the public. We’ve started to map stimulu transportation investments in most of the MidAtantic states on PolicyMap and hope to post a link to those later this week – in the meantime, check out some of our current work to see what we are talking about.</p>
<p>We would recommend that any platform used by Recovery.org to make stimulus investments transparent to the public possess, at a minimum, the following abilities:</p>
<p>1. Recovery.gov’s database and mapping platform should be a <strong>national online platform</strong>that allows users to see stimulus investments in a standardized way throughout the county. States have begun to create their own websites showcasing their investments (which is great), but they appear in different formats. Some have pdfs listing their investments, others have begun to create state maps showing investment dollars, and still others offer a series of tables showing investments by county. As these sites proliferate, it will become difficult to compare information across important planning geographies (like MSAs) or by type of investment. <strong>Creating a uniform format and then providing states and grantees with the ability to load their investment data directly into a single national platform</strong> will allow stimulus dollars investments to be both transparent to the public and easy to analyze across geographies and investment types.</p>
<p>2. Once loaded, individual stimulus investments should appear as clickable points or shapes in a fast, online map. The mapping component needs to be able to display the exact locations of investments (points or shapes) so that people can zoom into a neighborhood or city or MSA and see EXACTLY where the money is going. <strong>The mapping needs to show not just where the money went, but for what purpose, how much and to whom.</strong> And the location on the map should provide a link back to the agency that received the funds. <strong>The public needs an online interactive map to see where investments have been made in their city, neighborhood, block or next door. </strong>For an example , this link shows investments at the neighborhood levels on an interactive map. You can zoom, pan, and search for locations and click on any point to read the details of the investments.</p>
<ol></ol>
<a title="Investments at a neighborhood level" href="http://www.policymap.com//map?o=80150&amp;ofilters=&amp;cx=-75.23246613559377&amp;cy=39.9779166915507&amp;cz=13&amp;iwx=39.9754&amp;iwy=-75.2365&amp;iwtype=identify&amp;iwtab=0&amp;cx=-75.23246613559377&amp;cy=39.9779166915507&amp;cz=13" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i675.photobucket.com/albums/vv118/PolicyMap/IDBubble.jpg" alt="Investments at the neighborhood level" height="267" width="400" /></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The online mapping platform also needs to <strong>house information beyond just the locations of the stimulus investments.</strong> Federal dollars allocated to communities through the stimulus (or even other federal programs) should be a part of the platform and displayed thematically. Users should be able to simply <strong>mouse over any geography in the nation to see how much federal money they are getting.</strong> They should be able to overlay the stimulus site investments themselves to then see exactly where that money went within one integrated platform. For an example this link shows a map of Earned Income Tax Credit received by zip code in 2006.</p>
<a title="EITC by Zip Code" href="http://www.policymap.com//map?p=676150&amp;i=9586270&amp;btd=8&amp;period=2006&amp;ofilters=&amp;cx=-75.24831695636732&amp;cy=39.99192722412711&amp;cz=10&amp;iwx=39.97444464140758&amp;iwy=-75.26423195050432&amp;iwtype=identify&amp;iwtab=0&amp;cx=-75.24831695636732&amp;cy=39.99192722412711&amp;cz=10" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i675.photobucket.com/albums/vv118/PolicyMap/ExpandEITC.jpg" alt="EITC by zip code" height="253" width="400" /></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. When it comes to any conversation about <strong>investments in “place”, the need for accurate, relevant and timely information about neighborhoods, cities, metro areas, and states is essential</strong>. The government is a repository of great public data; information about unemployment from BLS, tax return data from t<strong>he IRS, population characteristics from the Census and many other statistics are regularly</strong> collected and freely available. By incorporating this type of information in the online platform, users can see on a map not just where dollars directed at creating new jobs have gone, but see what the unemployment rate is in that area; users can see not just where homes are receiving weatherization assistance, but what the average age of a home is in that area, etc. This capacity gives the Recovery.gov site the potential to become <strong>not just a place for the presentation of data, but as an underlying tool for evaluating the impact of investments.</strong> This map shows an investment at a specific place layered over the vacancy rate. Combining context data layers is necessary to diagnose need and measure the effect of recovery dollars.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.policymap.com//map?p=866356&amp;i=9631212&amp;btd=6&amp;o=80150&amp;period=2008q4&amp;ofilters=&amp;cx=-75.23246613559377&amp;cy=39.9779166915507&amp;cz=13&amp;iwx=39.9754&amp;iwy=-75.2365&amp;iwtype=identify&amp;iwtab=0&amp;cx=-75.23246613559377&amp;cy=39.9779166915507&amp;cz=13"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i675.photobucket.com/albums/vv118/PolicyMap/ExpandVacancy.jpg" alt="Residential Vacancy Data" height="259" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>5. The platform must be searchable by the public. While Recovery.gov will need to display a series of pre-drawn tables and graphs that help to visually display where stimulus dollars are being allocated, <strong>the underlying online database platform must be searchable by the public</strong>. As states and grantees upload their investments information into the single online platform, <strong>users should be able to quickly download a list of investments meeting any number of criteria so a whole range of questions can be answered on the fly.</strong> From “How many energy investments have been made as a part of the stimulus in my city compared to another city?” “How have stimulus dollars been allocated by congressional district?” “What are the education investments being made in my neighborhood being used for?” Making information accessible and making information usable are two different things. The stimulus investment reporting must allow citizens to interact with the data in useful ways to answer questions about their communities.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Recovery.gov needs to pursue a solution that provides the public with detailed information about the use of stimulus dollars in a single national web platform that can generate easy-to-understand visuals like maps and tables - &nbsp;as well as sophisticated reports and analysis.</p>
<p>Adoption of an online platform also provides the federal government with a unique opportunity to take this all a step further and create - in one, single place - a repository of cross-silo, public data that can be used to:</p>
<p>1) provide the public with free access to public data;</p>
<p>2) evaluate how communities are changing over time as a result of stimulus investments; and</p>
<p>3) open up GIS data for local communities as they consider where future investments make sense.</p>
<p>Online data and mapping capacities give the government an opportunity to do this quickly and cost-effectively.&nbsp; The tools have already been developed and are ready to use in applications like PolicyMap.com.</p>

<p>I agree that online mapping tied into other data sources is part of the essential suite of visualization methods required. Besides GIS mapping, I'd like to see relationship mapping (of contractors/agencies), systems mapping (all the environmental projects, say, and how they link into larger policy goals).

Besides GIS mapping, I'd like to see relationship mapping (of contractors/agencies), systems mapping (all the environmental projects, say, and how they link into larger policy goals).

<p>Adding national mapping capabilities like those available on PolicyMap to recovery.gov would introduce an unprecedented level of transparency to the pattern of recovery spending. while at the same time offering the public an easy way to connect the dots between stimulus dollars and concrete outcomes.</p>

<p>The central aspect of mapping is adding geocodes to all data items, and making data searchable and extractable by those geocodes (e.g, through use of an Open Geospatial Consortium WMS and WFT queries).&nbsp; That way, data can be mapped in lots of ways, by lots of people, for lots of purposes - not just in pre-canned ways.</p>

<p>Maps do provide increased transparency to data, graphically showing citizens data of interest in their area, and providing a natural way to zoom into more detail. All the ideas you've proposed are important, though I would also add <em>user-generated content</em>

<p>Although your site displays an impressive amount of effort, I'd caution that the average citizen wants easy-to-use and easy-to-understand maps of programs and spending, and does not necessarily need to get lost in details or related economic data. Such layers are interesting for an economist, but for Recovery.gov, maps showing programs and spending, with links to explanations elsewhere on Recovery.gov would be best.</p>

<p>Agreed. We've loaded in over 4,000 variables from public sources (Census, IRS, FBI, Postal Service, BLS, HUD, etc.) as well as
variables that users send us - so the underlying database/platform is
extensive.&nbsp; One of our goals was to load as much public data as we could
get our hands on into one fast, national, web application.&nbsp; And, we really
wanted users to able to overlay address level points on top of thematic
neighborhood data.&nbsp; So, the capacity to do this kind of mapping on
recovery.gov is there.&nbsp; PolicyMap's users are public policy makers, state
and local governments, foundations, financial institutions and the like.&nbsp;
An application designed for the public would need a different user interface.</p>

<p>What we're seeing here is that nearly everyone agrees that map views of stimulus data are essential, but everyone has their own ideas of precisely what information they'd like to include in such a map. Sure recovery.gov can (&amp; should) provide some common map views, but it would serve people even better if it provided a way that people could easily create their own map views (and other views), fill them with whatever recovery data they want, and then share them with the world.</p>

<p>PolicyMap technology looks promising because it's not just about mapping the investments -- rich local information is key, otherwise the spending has no context.&nbsp; Recovery.gov should provide an accessible way to make sense of the spending and its impact in communities.&nbsp; It's not about complex geospatial analysis, it's about letting people quickly and easily stack up what's going on around the country.</p>

<p>We all like lots of information for feeding our systems and processing data, which could give us a clue about some ongoing events. What we do with that data is called autocorrelation (comparing data to set patterns or ACR), such as what DHS does. This is where we need to focus our attention, at more levels of ACR.&nbsp;One important&nbsp;area is the financial stability, which needs&nbsp;new&nbsp;ACR markers, such as, loans foclosures, late payments, job losses, bank account activities, savings, taxes (real estate, autos, businesses), etc. Then and only then will we be able to measure the pulse of economic stability and growth, and not just use the market as&nbsp;the only indicator.&nbsp;Afterall, what happen&nbsp;in Wall Street in the past 18 months, with the loss of 3 trillion dollars in value and assets, resulted in&nbsp;every citizen paying for poor and unfair melt down of market value caused by leverging of funds that did not exist&nbsp;after the&nbsp;marketeers stool the rest. Citizens lost their trust and net worth, as well as belief that Congress in its efforts to deregulate the financial institutions was even thinking of the worst that could happen to&nbsp;us. This has got to change if we&nbsp;are to survive as a nation.

<p>Access. Ease-of-use.Transparency. Portability. Data aggregation. Simple presentation. These seem to be some of the recurring themes among the Ideas populating this web site. And it seems to me that a mapping interface like PolicyMap is perfectly suited to the aims of the Recovery effort. Thematic maps are a great way to monitor and communicate the "where" and "how much" on the investment side, as well as on the ROI (return) side of the ledger over time, e.g., in terms of positive changes in local wealth, employment, housing values, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm an IT professional and I understand the importance of interoperability and freedom of information, but this stage of the game needs to be focused on a consumer level website. This needs to be netflix or amazon, not some behemoth unified system. PolicyMap is the closest thing to a retail site that I've seen linked from in this discussion. (Maybe others are retail-like, but this is the only one that I was able to get on and figure out for myself.)</p>

<p>If you can get the states and local entities who are doing to the work to standarized how their lists are formatted, to report the same information, then load their info into this platform, that would far and away more than would I ever would expect of the federal government -- and that could be just the beginning.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the geocommons map but if this is for the public good, I'd like to see such software provided under the AGPL free software license. That would mean that any user could download the source to the mapping/mashup software and set it up on their own server. Then they can download the same data from the government source repo. This will maximize the ability of each user to verify what they're looking at and the software they're using to make important policy decisions.</p>

I think this is a great visualization idea.
<p>However, I would be very reluctant to post street addresses of individual single family homes that have received assistance. This could make the homeowners subject to scammers (like the guys who show up and offer to replace that gnarly looking roof, then take off with all your money and the job half done). It also could place their jobs at risk (some employers are unwilling to keep employees who are "risky"), or cause family problems if a family chose not to divulge their money issues to other family members. Differentiating between individuals who need a certain level of privacy and municipal projects that require public scrutiny would be a good idea.</p>

<p>I think we could use other types of visual aids as well - bar charts, pie charts, all the standard ways of viewing data, but I really like a map on which you can zoom.&nbsp; I'd love to see such a thing combined with a "citizen reporting" interface that allows people on the ground in a given community to report local information about progress, perhaps with some kind of rating capability (progress = excellent, good, fair, poor; quality = excellent, good, fair, poor).</p>

<p>This is by far one of the best ideas put forth in this forum. I have seen firsthand the use of grants data overlayed with other relevant data that can help evaluate the effectiveness of a program. For example, overlaying crime statistics before a grant is issued and then looking at the same information categories after the grant has been executed can yield some very telling results.</p>

<p>One area of difficulty submitting agencies may have is the normalization of the data boundaries. Some of the typical geocoding that&nbsp;I have encountered for defining a grant's service delivery area can be expressed in a number of various ways (address, radius from center point, political boundary, Zip code, census tract,&nbsp; free-hand polygons expressed as lat/lon points) and the conversion from one input standard to a different display standard (for example input by Congressional District but displayed by State/Municipality) can skew the accuracy of the presentation. For example;&nbsp;if one area of interest was how many jobs created in a given area (Congressional District) but the collection data was oriented to a city that straddles two districts you can see results displayed wher none really exist.&nbsp;This is where the anticipated use of the data may drive how it is initialy collected and could ripple back to the grant application format and forward throught the grant perfromance measures collection methods.</p>

				Build on open source!

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Use open source or "community edition" tools for data warehousing, data analysis, reporting, visualization, e.g., Infobright ICE; Eclipse BIRT.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Save money. Avoid getting tied up with commercial vendors and licenses. Extend "community developed" concept of recovery.gov to the tools that support the site. Prove value of open source solutions to government requirements in general. Provide additional assurance to public that analyses are sound, i.e. others will be able to independently replicate results using the same software in a controlled environment. Create a model, templates, reference architecture for future government data aggregation and reporting requirements. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I think it is incorrect to suggest that open source systems will save money.&nbsp;Many government customers today own prodcuts they can leverage, without bringing new open source requirements into their architecture.&nbsp; More importantly, government customers&nbsp;&nbsp;should be looking at their enterprise architectures and understanding how to&nbsp;simplify the environment to reduce costs and improve security.</p>

<p>I am an open source advocate but it is also true that there are many existing applications that will already do much of what is required. If the goal is economic recovery we shouldn't be eliminating competition. However, the data should be open-sourced and in a commonly used format. That way we can build our own applications on top of it...since the application interface tends to flatter the point-of-view of the interface's owner we will get a more accurate(?) picture by crowdsourcing it.</p>

<p>In the context of the recovery.gov mission, it is far more important to focus on open standards, which is not the same as open source. With open standards, different companies, big or small can provide interoperable solutions by creating a well defined layer of abstraction, or services layer. This way, everyone benefits - remember economic recovery is about creating jobs, investing in people, so they can turn around an buy goods and services. Companies of all sizes are made of people, good, hard working people, with families and financial responsibilities. Those companies are the same companies that contribute to the open source community to foster the innovation and freedom of exploration. Your examples of open source underscore this: BIRT, eclipse, etc are all supported and/or contributed by companies.</p>

<p>I would recommend that everyone take a hard look at what is at stake here. The recovery.gov infrastructure should leverage open standards to foster interoperability. The best solutions for the government should abide by these open standards, and if some components are open source, than that is great, however the government should not limit themselves to *only* considering OSS to meet these critical challenges...there is a win-win solution here with open standards for business and government to realize the mission of economic recovery.</p>

<p>Open Source as a means for saving money is moot at the enterprise level. The reason Open Source technologies, formats and standards are better for government is simply that open code means accountability, transparency and accessibility. The very same attributes I require of my government I also require of the information the government makes public. While I would prefer the government rely more heavily on enterprise open source within the agencies, I am much more interested in open document formats (I do not own Microsoft Office for example), open descriptions of the methodologies used to analyse the data, open publishing technologies that allow me to remove and manipulate the data. Open source breeds open ideas breeds open accountability. It's not the answer, but it's a great tool, especially when employed in the public domain. You want interoperable health information technology? Go open source. We talk to each other out of the box.</p>

				Enhanced Analysis and Visualization
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>An idea for both the topic listed above and some of the earlier suggestions about enhanced visualizations and analytics, I'd like to submit an example of some of the options that should be pursued.&nbsp; We generally find that the approaches that often fail in data management and analysis&nbsp;are too many lists, spreadsheets, and columns of data.&nbsp; By using interactive visualizations, providing different levels of aggregation, and giving more in-depth analysis only where desired, you can turn volumes of data into usable information.&nbsp; We've taken the data at Recovery.gov (up to and including the Financial and Activity Reports added last week (dated 4/17/09) and created an interactive, dynamic dashboard of all of the data.&nbsp; In this way, you can do some top-level analysis, comparing agencies to each other and looking at the program as a whole, but also look at the individual agency over time.&nbsp; Take a look at it and let us know what you think.&nbsp; Link: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.microstrategy.com/recovery-act-data/">http://www.microstrategy.com/recovery-act-data/</a></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>We believe the pages within&nbsp;RECOVERY.GOV should provide the end users with at least this level of interactivity and functionality, so that citizens can perform all the analysis they desire in an easy-to-understand and easy-to-use way.</p>

<p>This is an excellent dashboard example.&nbsp; I particularly like the ability to animate the data over time!&nbsp;This&nbsp;single dashboard consolidates almost all the information that is available in over 100 spreadsheets on Recovery.gov, and it does so in a way that is visually appealing and easy to navigate.&nbsp; This would save lots of time for anyone interested in analyzing the Recovery data - whether public official or private citizen.<img class="image-inline image-inline" src="RecoveryAnalysis.jpg" alt="Recovery Data - animated over time" height="432" width="575" />&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is critically important.&nbsp; The growing number of "mashups" - that combine data from multiple sources, to address specific needs and interests, is testament to the need to make data available in usable and "composeable" forms, rather than trying to funnel all information through a pre-defined set of tools.&nbsp; There is growing literature to this effect, particularly as regards design of municipal information sites, and, as I seem to recall, the administration's new CIO and CTO are both strong proponents of this approach as well.</p>

<p>Data Formats are extremely important, and many programs and applications try to lock users into their proprietary format, But raw data is the real useful data, this is what people are going to be doing their analysis with, and what people want access to. when it comes down to it, most of the people doign research are familiar with spreadsheets, whether it is CSV's, Microsoft Excel, or Open Office as an open source alternative. People can ussually get spreadsheet data into any format that they need for their specific need. I'm involved in web-based mapping, and a lot of what we do is converting spreadsheets into interactive maps. just my 2 cents.</p>

<h1>
				Open Data Will Enable Democratized Analysis and Accountability
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Focus on making the data available rather than the analysis.</p>
<p>In order to meet the goal of open data, the government should look to create data portals using technologies with wide market adoption, like XML-based web services. Web services such as SOAP and REST are self- documenting, quick, platform-independent, and currently allow for the most flexible access to the data in question.&nbsp; Third parties will make the most interesting use of the data. If a site like Recovery.org focuses on providing Open Data (timely, raw, and technologically neutral), it will leverage the passion and creativity of the populace to ensure real transparency and accountability.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>As a software architecture specialist with 15 years experience building information systems for large customers including federal agencies such as the Department of Treasury, OMB, the US Navy, the CIA and OPIC, I can assure you that that the biggest challenge with this exercise will not be the format or operating system, but rather the volume of data and complexity of providing it in real time without straining the underlying infrastructure or creating privacy risks.&nbsp; The identification, provision and documentation of query tables (revealing whatever data the government intends to share) is the most basic first step.</p>
<p>Speaking at a technology event in Northern Virginia, newly appointed National CIO Vivek Kundra agreed that open data is the key, saying he was "deeply committed to opening up data to make it machine readable and easier for people to use/mix/mash." The real creativity will come from passionate citizens and organizations that will follow specific aspects of government regulation, and government spending.&nbsp; Similar to other public private partnerships, citizens and organizations will combine government data with outside sources (mash-ups) to produce useful tools that enhance our lives. A quick review of projects that have already been created from simple data dumps show just how much creativity exists.&nbsp; For example, <a href="http://www.OpenRegs.com">www.OpenRegs.com</a> is a website that taps into data underpinning the Federal Register and allows individuals and organizations to have a real-time look at the regulations that will affect them.</p>
<p>The infinite manifestations of data suggest that the worst thing the government could do is to try and anticipate all potential uses of the data by attempting to implement some grand master system. As Kundra also said, "technology changes so fast that by the time one standard comes along, there's another, and another, which is why government can't lock-in on one standard.”&nbsp; There will be lag time between the release of the data and the availability of functional reports but it’s nothing compared the delays inherent in a monolithic and over debated central system. Never was the KISS Principle more relevant.</p>
<p>Start simple, make the data available. I think we’ll all be amazed at the results.</p>

<p>I agree with the principle that public accountability will provide much of the transparency intended by the law.&nbsp; There is still a need, however, to enable the OIGs and other government oversight bodies to perform the necessary governance of the government funds because otherwise we essentially allow watchdog groups and other organizations with potentially conflicting political agendas to provide the oversight.</p>

<p>This is a great summary of the information gathering challenges faced by all large organizations and is not unique to government.&nbsp; The ‘stakeholders’ are slightly different, and the issue is particularly unique for our government(s) in this environment because citizen’s expectations for access and transparency are increasing – and the trend appears to be accelerating.</p>

<p>To expand on the idea - the complexity of gathering data from so many different locations, attempting to aggregate it, and then display on recovery.gov is certainly daunting.&nbsp; However, attempting to create a master data dictionary, complex reporting requirements, or technology mandates is not a reasonable expectation considering we are talking about so many jurisdictions, with widely varying capabilities and technologies.</p>

<p>Recipients and participants in ARRA (and government into the future) should be encouraged to spend energy, time, and resources to manage data <strong>‘at the point of creation’</strong>, then make the data available.&nbsp; Systems and processes that facilitate first-rate workflow and capture details <em>when the data is created </em>will produce high-quality data that in turn can be organized and become useful information (to your point in ways that will amaze us).&nbsp; Although technology can (and should) help, this is not a technical problem, nor does anyone have a magic bullet.&nbsp; Its messy, hard work and our hands are going to get dirty.&nbsp; Too often the focus is on ‘organizing’ data and not enough time considering where the data came from. &nbsp;Garbage in, garbage out.</p>

<p>As technology-aware individuals, the challenge should be how to empower the average citizen to ask a question they perceive will provide relevant “information” and receive an answer that is highly correlated to that question.&nbsp; Lacking this functionality, in my mind, leaves us with a large national database that government or corporations can “interpret” for citizens but not truly put the power of data access and transparency in their hands.</p>

<p>I'm certainly not against open data and it's nice to believe that standard protocols will be used. However, I do worry that the Gov. spends too much time arguing over the particulars (i.e. XML vs. JSON vs...) which causes a lot of wasted time and energy.</p>

<p>I think Recovery.gov should specify what's provided, the minimum granular and how it should be calculated. I worry we'll end up with two departments or projects each declaring a specific $ for a metric but we'll be comparing apples to oranges and not even know it.</p>

<p>Computers are great at translating from one standard to another so give the departments an initial choice.

I realize there could be a danger of forcing a standard according to one broken library but starnds like json.org or BeautifulSoup would go a long way towards validating services according to some readilly available standards checks / libraries.</p>

<p>I'm wondering how XML and JSON handle relationships between tables in a large database. If the data were using PostrgreSQL or MySQL the dumps from either of those datbases would preserve all that relational information and might be preferable to those of us with servers ready to store and process this info.</p>

<p>I would like to second the part about "that the biggest challenge with this exercise will not be the format or
operating system, but rather the volume of data and complexity of
providing it in real time without straining the underlying
infrastructure or creating privacy risks." But I would like to add that large-scale data sharing enabled and even ecouraged by the federal government will be hugely influenced by the implementation choice.</p>

<p>SOAP is hard to scale for truly large-scale scenarios, because the request semantics are hidden in each call. RESTful HTTP, on the other hand, has built-in scalability mechanisms, so that large-scale government data services could be implemented with out-of-the-box methods such as reverse proxies, sensible caching strategies, and good RESTful design of services. This really matters, and makes even more sense when looking at recovery.gov as a test-bed for the much bigger effort required for data.gov.</p>

<p>Maybe I don't get it; however, I would have thought that making the data available would be a basic requirement of the recovery. There are well tried and trusted methods for data exchange. We have to get past that and look at the information instead of the data. To do that we have to understand what is happening to the monies. -&nbsp;My 2 cents.</p>

<p>A great example is the Hospital Compare database made available by HHS. HHS publishes a (IMHO) messy MS Access file along with the data updates once a quarter. It is by no means an ideal format, but it's a few short hours to parse it out into a usable CSV and reimport it into an RDBMS to do all kinds of cool things with it. Speaking to my prior point, Hospital Compare is the source of the data, and publishes it accurately and faithfully, but the myriad Web sites that do other interesting things with that data are just as useful, for example the ones that break it down to state-level data and contextualize it by adding in data HHS doesn't have.</p>

<p>I think this is the crux of the argument, and one I have seen actually attempted at state and federal levels more than once. Your point is well-made, and is an easy trap to fall into, however I think we should not over-react by removing this responsibility entirely from recovery.gov, but instead making sure the data is freely available to all of us who can use it to *add to* and not replace the analysis performed by the feds themselves.</p>

<p>For one thing, there is an army of people out there who want to read analysis on a dot gov site, not a dot com and maybe not even a dot org.

<p>I offer for consideration that open data, sans analysis, taken out of context can be worse than no data at all. The potential to draw erroneus conclusions from incorrect interpretations of raw data is high and once an invalid conclusion is drawn it can have devastating effects on the oppionion of the effectiveness or worthiness of an endeavor. I suggest that the federal agencies charged with the stewardship of these programs have an obligation to provide data with fair and honest analysis to ensure the non-agency evaluator has, at the minimum, a professional analysis at their disposal to compare against the raw data. The democratization of data does not automatically equate nor lend itself to the establishment of good policy (or the management thereof). To summarize my view, open or raw data requies context. Whether you offer up the raw source data or not, don't discard the analysis.</p>

<p>There are many excellent ideas on this site which address systems, processes and communication of information, but the most critical component to the Recovery Act program is transparency and accountability of our tax dollars being allocated, committed and spent and the associated results. Without a construction project management system, regardless of delivery method (SaaS, On Premise, hybrid) enforcing procedures and processes behind projects we cannot be certain of the validity of the information being presented.</p>

<p>SaaS means is you give the data to some other entity and use their software to have it do what you want. The problem is when a bug is found or you need a new feature, you are really at the mercy of the SaaS provider.

There are more tools than ever that are available under free software licenses to handle large amounts of data, do reporting, ERP, and all kinds of other tasks for which proprietary vendors are proposing their solutions. In addition any code that is written for this purpose should be made available for public review and improvement. Together we can do much more.</p>

<h1>
				Single Reporting system for grants using BPM
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The federal agencies should provide one single system that will track grants from the moment they are awarded and allow the grantees and sub grantees to be able to report back through that tracking system.</p>
<p>While this concept may seem impossible to traditional grants management IT folks, the technology is readily available and can be implemented very quickly. The technology is Business Process Management (BPM). The leading BPM vendor, Appian Corporation, can implement such as system in a matter of months with effective security to ensure data integrity. Appian does that for the USArmy now with 2 million users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The idea is important because: 1) six months from now when grantees are expected to report back on performance and ROI on the investment from these grants, there is going to be very wide discrepancy between what the federal agencies report and what the grantees report. This is due to the lack of standardization and mechanisms available to the grantees and the sub grantees; 2) there is currently no single reporting system available that all grantees and sub grantees can afford; 3) the federal agencies would save millions of dollars in reconciliation expenses</p>

<p>I think in addition to tracking when they're awarded it should also track when they're announced.</p>

<p>While BPM is a technical concept, the reality is that there are only less than a handful of unique grant types, and many folks in govt beleive that managing a grant is not much different than administering a contract.&nbsp; Regardless, the Recovery Act requires speed and scalability of agency operations.&nbsp; Using BPM, agencies could standardize on a high quality grants administration approach, within types of grants, and grants admin could be synchronized with financial systems to get controls in place.&nbsp; This buy once, use many approach may be the only way for agencies to rapidly get the capacity and controls that are&nbsp;needed for the Recovery Act.</p>

				Program management &amp; reporting software provides full transparency
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>CapEx Manager is a market tested solutions that will allow the Federal Government to reach its goal of full transparency and accountability as the&nbsp;American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is carried out across the county. The software will allow each participating organization to effectively manage day-to-day operations throughout their entire Program Lifecycle.&nbsp; Data flows seamlessly between each phase of the program, from bid preparation, to procurement, through&nbsp;project management, to project closeout.&nbsp;The system enables issues to be managed and resolved as they surface, information to be viewed,&nbsp;and costs and schedules&nbsp;to be controlled.&nbsp; Through the course of each project, the public entity responsible for the project, the federal government, and citizens will have real-time views on how their project is progressing, where issues exist and what is being done to&nbsp;make certain the project is being delivered in an appropriate manner.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This type of solution is extremely important.&nbsp; As identified by the act itself, there is a requirement for full transparency of all expenditures of dollars that fund this initiative.&nbsp; Taxpayers be able to know how, when, and where there tax dollars are being spent.&nbsp; Those spending the dollars should also have the tools to adequately manage the projects being funded.</p>

<p>If this solution provides an audit trail of all program management capital expenditures with construction detail and payments, as well as all activities tied to contractors and sub-contractors awarded to a project, it would be a valuable tool for government oversight of the use of recovery funds. Also,&nbsp;if this solution tracks WBE and&nbsp;MBE participation, it would be invaluable toward tracking and identifiying who is benefiting from these&nbsp;construction activities.</p>

<p>CapEx Manager does have full audit trail capabiltiy that provides full detail on all payments to contractors and sub-contractors.&nbsp; Further, it tracks participation of all MBE and WBE organizations participating in the project.&nbsp; All vendor, contractors and sub-contractor registration is completed by those firms through the system.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				8th Grade Basal Reading Level of Data Aggregation in Visual form
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>To meet the fundamental goals of a publicly accessible and understandable forum for Recovery.gov as a place where the public can monitor the expenditure and use of recovery funds data must be presented in a format keyed to the average reading level (ca. 8th), and further aggregated in an overtly simplistic way through a declining funds remaining bar, with a national and state based navigation interface.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The vast majority of the public relies on news agency data aggregation because 20 (small local level) page excel printouts are too complex.&nbsp; On a state level, the budget may exceed 400 pages, and on a federal level the budget easily exceeds 20,000 line-item pages of payees.</p>
<p>to be "transparent and publicly accessible" the page needs a simple interface, on the main page, with a declining fund bar (perhaps "cute") and a image hotmap allowing the public to key into local areas of interest to see how funds are being distributed in relevant agencies that affect their life.</p>
<p>What currently exists is woefully inadequate, nontransparent, obfuscated, and currently disappointing.</p>
<p>This should not require billions to implement, and should be no more complicated than the websites that presidential candidates would display to convey information and financial information/fundraising progress.</p>

<p>This is an excellent idea.&nbsp; Not only for those that only have a basic 8th grade reading level, but also for those of us that don't desire for their eyes to cross when trying to decipher the legal-speak and translate it into basic English again.</p>

<p>I consider myself to be educated enough to understand at least up to a high school graduate's reading level, and yet I find it very difficult to easily understand half of what the government releases to the general public as "transparent information".&nbsp; How can it be transparent if too few people actually understand it?</p>

<p>Aside from that, the even greater benefit would be that we can show our children (depending on age level of course), and actually get them involved in the affairs of the country again.&nbsp; It would be nice if those children 8th grade and up could understand the information to be better educated adults.&nbsp; The more information we can give them before they enter adulthood, the better they will be prepared to assist the rest of us with ideas and volunteer work when they are older.</p>

<p>I was just looking through some of the ideas and approaches that have been recently posted and came across this one. I agree with your concern that although it is an appreciated effort they are making, but with the disparity of the data it is very difficult to make sense of, or make any kind of informed conclusions.. Take a look at this prototype dashboard we created: <a href="http://www.microstrategy.com/recovery-act-data/"><u>http://www.microstrategy.com/recovery-act-data/</u></a></p>

<p>This is a great product because it's easy to complete, can be worked on in concert with your team -if you have one- and can be shared or networked online instantly with anyone wanting to take a look. I like that it's compliant and complete and includes due diligence items to save processing and closing costs.  
Such a platform can make the funding of small business more accessible, and provide a leg up for entrepreneurs not already well connected to funding sources. I'd say this is a must-have also for SBA as an insurer and all related processing and storage. Excellent concept and execution.</p>

<p>As a business development professional this could be <u>the</u>
product that can really help turn things around for us. It standardizes the
business plan and due diligence process for business financing and investment
and that in itself is a major accomplishment. The standardization and digital
format will allow for tremendous cost savings, for all parties involved,
because it allows for all sorts of computer applications, and associated search
capabilities, to be applied to the business financing and investment process
and significantly streamline it. The standardization also brings with it a greater
level of transparency that changes the due diligence process from one of high cost
investigation to one of low cost verification. Its standardization will further
streamline the process and shorten the funding time dramatically just by the
fact that the entrepreneur/ business will now present a complete package (presentation,
business plan, interactive financials, due diligence report and support documentation),
everything needed by any lender or investor to make a decision on funding their
application, the first time out. Because the application is web based, entrepreneurs/
businesses can now truly exploit the global business financing and investment capital
funding pool because now any financial institution or investor, anywhere on the
planet, can be given the opportunity to see and review a complete package for
funding. In fact, with computer/ Internet search capabilities, it will allow financial
institutions and investor to actively seek, screen and categorize business
ideas and funding requests from anywhere in the world. If nothing else, it is a
rock solid “disaster” risk management tool for any business and can
tremendously improve relief efforts when disaster do strike. With a properly
filled out copy safely stored on the web, when disaster strikes all you need to
do is get an Internet connection and you have everything you need to immediately
apply for business relief, financing or investment and the government can, with
just a few clicks of a mouse, easily designate different areas for relief and
other special funding. Just an all round excellent product, I think it would
definitely be worth looking into as part of the solution to our current
economic crisis. I think it is a win/ win situation for everyone involved that
can bring about tremendous cost savings, greater transparency, while, improving
funding rates for entrepreneurs/ businesses and opening the door for them to
the global financing &amp; investment pool; I’d say it’s the right product, at
the right time for our time!</p>

<p>I thought this was a brilliant product. Finally, someone's taken business funding out of the paper age and into the digital age. It should make it a lot more transparent to all involved as well as allow for some automated oversight of the entire funding process. It could be a great source for real time economic data that can be taken down to the neighorhood, since it is based on a digital platform. It should really speed up the process of getting funds to small business as a whole.</p>

<p>This idea is an actual system post-R&amp;D -&nbsp;ready to go.&nbsp; It does for business plans what the SEC forms does for the capital markets, provides a standardized plan and disclosure system for investors, and makes it faster to create a compliant and accurate&nbsp;report while also making it faster to navigate for any reviewer wishing to quickly find prioritized information critical to making an investment decision at any stage of the expedited due diligence process without compromising comprehensiveness and fine detail.&nbsp; Everything is done in vitual space in much less time with far more accurate results.&nbsp; This is a new era that calls for new solutions to age old problems that haven't quite caught up to be at par with our new technological capabilities. The Funding Roadmap is the epitome of this idea, and it is entirely a global perspective that benefits everyone everywhere on all sides of the equation.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Accurate and reliable reporting of&nbsp;agency's data sets is critical in gaining public trust of the&nbsp;government initiatives and&nbsp;results. Disperate data also require adherence to uniform data standards to enable data analysis and decision making.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Data quality and data standards are fundamental to decision making. Having hundreds (if not thousands) of data sources based on a variety of data standards make the analysis and decisions based on such "bad" data unsound.</p>

<p>I think this is true when you are talking about big "D" data, or quantitative performance measure kinds of data.&nbsp;But, it can take a long time to reach agreement on the definitions and data standards.&nbsp; Given the potentially thousands of&nbsp;"players" in these projects, it may be easiest for the Feds to send out clearly defined measures and data standards.&nbsp; As a state representative, though, I must say that it usually works best if the states, state partners&nbsp;and Federal Government partner on the definitions.&nbsp; The states live the reality a little closer to the ground and often provide useful modifications and insights.&nbsp; It can take up to a year to modify state data systems to capture new information.</p>

<p>That's why leadership is vital. The way agreement on the U.S. GAAP tags was reached so quickly was that the right experts were compelled to work together on a tight deadline to come up with a draft; the draft was exposed to a highly efficient and robust public comment process using cutting edge Wiki-style software (created by a company Warren Buffett funds called Core Filing); and the final arbiters had authority to make tough calls, knowing that the X in XBRL stands for eXtensible, which makes up for any mistakes until the taxonomy can be revised (which can also be done quickly, with the right leadership). In fact, had the federal government itself tried to do the work using standard operating procedures, the project probably would have ended up like a large plurality of government software projects -- in failure.</p>

<p>Another advantage of XBRL is that software doesn't need to be updated to handle new data tags and new data -- all that must be done to deal with an updated taxonomy is to tell the software where on the Internet it can find the updated taxonomy. More than 8,000 smaller U.S. banks and tens of thousands of smaller entities around the world are using XBRL software successfully. State and local governments should enjoy the same cost savings and productivity improvements it's giving these other organizations.</p>

<p>Yes, the standards must be easy to implement. David Stephenson's idea to use XBRL at <a href="../web-based-reporting-process-similar-to-turbotax">http://www.thenationaldialogue.org/ideas/web-based-reporting-process-similar-to-turbotax</a>&nbsp;is excellent. In fact, using XBRL should be&nbsp;even easier for end users than using TurboTax, since there isn't a century of tax law with which to deal. A major reason to use any XML-based standard is that will be less expensive for end users than current systems.</p>

<p>XBRL is rather simple once you get past the&nbsp;experts charging to translate the jargon (and with so many XML experts,&nbsp;even overpaying for XBRL expertise is&nbsp;much cheaper and much more transparent than buying proprietary systems). Even so, in the banking sector,&nbsp;small banks -- including mom &amp; pop-type operations -- find XBRL cost effective because they don't need to understand XBRL technology. The software hides&nbsp;the scary looking symbols. (Any town getting federal money should at least have a bookkeeper approximately as competent as the one inputting data at the small bank next door to city hall.)</p>

<p>Independent governance of reporting standards is also important. NIEM is interesting. On its web site, <a href="http://www.ijis.org/">http://www.ijis.org/</a>, it says it "is a nonprofit membership organization funded primarily through grants from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Our members are information technology companies and consultancies that provide products or services to the justice, public safety, and homeland security sectors for the purpose of helping these communities share information."</p>

<p>It's worth considering whether taxpayer money should&nbsp;control a disclosure standard developed by vendors subsidized with&nbsp;taxpayer money. An advantage of XBRL is that it is a global standard with a well-developed independent governance model (see <a href="http://xbrl.org/">http://xbrl.org/</a>). XBRL International has&nbsp;operated much longer than NIEM, there's extensive off-the-shelf knowledge and software to handle the XBRL standard, and it's been proven in multiple other national reporting projects.</p>

<p>Despite the effort, a taxonomy must be created that allows for data to be compared precisely across multiple fields (geospace, professions, demographics, vendors, etc.) -- but the system must be fluid enough that users may manipulate the data sets to specific purposes. As the United States has developed good standard for data comparison since at least WWII there exists a reasonable baseline. The other advantage is that the funds have a reasonably stable source of origin. Based on this history and source a stable 0 point can be established, which can always be referenced to, while a far more useful baseline taxonomy can be evolved. This evolving data taxonomy will better reflect the type of Gov't spending scales we are now entering; the taxonomy must be nesting so users of all levels of expertise can drill down rapidly to pinpoint their areas of interest. If this is done properly voters will be able to understand the scope of cost/benefit. Another area where such a clear taxonomy would benefit would be in understanding debt "investment" vs. direct unrecoverable (i.e., future tax requirement) expenditure.</p>

				Gov. buildings should report their energy usage and track savings

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>If we're going to invest in Greening America then we should start (as the Gov has said) with America's Administration itself.</p>
<p>Green cars and green technology are an important part of our future success as a nation and I believe tracking and reporting that savings will ensure the type of transparency we need.</p>
<p>Every building that receives Goverment Reinvestment and Recovery funding for "greening" should be required to accurately report the savings that investment has made.</p>
<p>This reporting should be done by automated sensors and accounting methods, the type that man businesses are looking to develop and companies want to utilize to create our "smart grid".</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>It not only privodes a ready made "proving ground" for innovation and funds adoption and development but it serves to prove that an investment was worthwhile and not wasted.</p>

<p>I'm pretty certain it could be done quickly and easilly. First on a gross level (I know there are companies that do this) and then at finer and finer granularities as the platform is being developed.</p>

<p>Thanks for submitting your idea, wjhuie.&nbsp; Your idea inspired me to research and learn more about automated sensor technologies for monitoring and reporting.&nbsp; Specifically, I found the advanced metering infrastructure technology and so called 'smart grid-enabled devices' facinating.&nbsp; It will be interesting to witness the convergence of this monitoring infrastructure with new web technologies.</p>

<p>I'd be concerned that a solution such as this would draw the attention of a lot of big companies who would blow the requirements way out of proportion and what I'd like to see is this to be a "proving ground" for multiple suppliers.</p>

				XML Web Services

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Make recovery data available as a web service via SOAP XML.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This will allow web developers to develop their own tools and pages to display information in a data pull (not push) methodology.&nbsp; In fact, much much more government data should be available in this format.</p>

<p>I agree that some type of rigorous programmatic interface that allows developers to access the data from recovery.gov is essential.&nbsp; I think that SOAP and associated the rest of WS-* stack might be one way to implement such access mechanisms, but I would not want SOAP to the exclusive protocol used.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would argue, for instance, that a RESTful approach is also an excellent alternative to consider for recovery.gov.</p>

<p>I agree that the interaction between agencies that are involved in the data flows supporting the movement of data from the many sources to the various consolidation points would be greatly enhanced through the use of SOAP and XML.&nbsp; In fact, the standard eXtensible Business Reporting Language or XBRL is an XML schema or data model that was created to support financial management and the processes associated with large scale data traffic.&nbsp; The use of SOAP, XML with XBRL along with the Java Messaging Service or JMS will provide an open standards based framework that can scale from very small instances to very large bulk data traffic.&nbsp; This is a much more robust approach to interfacing discrete disparate systems than what is generally achieved with syndication style feeds.&nbsp; Have a look at the discussion on <em><strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-think43/">Thinking XML: Analyze financial reporting using XBRL.</a></strong></em></p>

<p>I agree with the RESTful approach. &nbsp;Since OMB is looking to use REST/ATOM/RSS, wouldn't it make sense to start with something compatible?</p>

<p>In short (bad spelling aside) and assuming the link works, I think you'll see that I believe the real focus now should be deciding what numbers are shared and standardizing on those calculations.</p>

<p>It's probably sufficient enough to say "share everything", something I believe, but if one group calculated headcount by excluding contractors and the other includes them, then we could inadvertently make a poor decision if we expected those numbers were equivalent.</p>

<p>I also believe the government should only rarely dictate technical details of "how" something is shared. It's too easy for the focus to be "this must be XML" or "this must be JSON" and the agency can meet the expecations of that declaration by supplying a XML file 1 minute per day.</p>

<p>If we can pull people's focus a little higher for a time and agree on standards of availability and accounting consistency I have no doubt that the technical savvy among us can render semantic implementation details like JSON vs. XML vs. WSDL irrelevant.</p>

<p>It would be good if XML schemas were published for all public information with definitions of each element contained in &lt;xsd:documentation&gt; elements within each schema.&nbsp; It would also be good if the draft XSD for the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) Data Reference Model (DRM) were finalized and implemented:&nbsp;<a href="http://xml.gov/draft/drm20060105.xsd">http://xml.gov/draft/drm20060105.xsd</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A&nbsp;common data source is nice, but we have to have consistency - that's the only way to compare state to state performance/adherence to the transparency.</p>

<p>While the idea of "XML Web Services" is a good one and should be pursued, it should not be done in the flavor of SOAP services. Instead, RESTful HTTP can deliver XML in a more Web-compatible way, and also is much more accessible in terms of required technologies. For example, mobile devices nowadays often have HTTP and XML support built-in, but using SOAP (and in particular potentially complex WS-* profiles) is not readily possible, and sometimes almost impossible because of device limitations. the use of <a href="http://journal.webscience.org/46/">Plain Web</a> technologies is a better foundation for data that should be as open, usable, and accessible as possible for the widest possible range of users, devices, and applications.</p>
