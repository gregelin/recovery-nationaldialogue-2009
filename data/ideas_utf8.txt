				Online cascading performance budgets and performance reports
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a new software solution now available that was

specifically designed to bring exactly this type of transparency and

accountability to federal agency spending, called CASCADE™ Performance Based

Budgeting Software.&nbsp; As the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.strategisys.com/software.html"><strong>online video demo</strong></a>

illustrates, CASCADE™ enables large government agencies to develop both

long-term strategic plans and annual performance budgets that show the measurable

goals, strategies, and budget costs on a program-by-program and

manager-by-manager basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With CASCADE™, program managers can also create separate goals

that relate just to Recovery Act funding and indicate that this spending is

distinct from their regular program budget amounts.&nbsp; For a federal agency with hundreds – even thousands – of

managers spread around the country, CASCADE™ can create a single, integrated,

online document with a hierarchical goal structure, showing cascading

performance budgets by program office and location all the way down through the

organization – with the responsible manager identified each step of the way.

And at each step, both the regular program goals, strategies, spending and

results, and the Recovery Act goals, strategies, spending and results, may be

shown for every organization and sub-unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that with this new software tool, an agency can

document how each element of Recovery Act spending achieves measurable results

that relate to existing program goals, a summary of the implementation

strategy, and who is responsible for guiding the effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CASCADE™ was designed by John Mercer, the “father of GPRA”

and is the result of a joint development project by Strategisys LLC

(Alexandria, VA) and Integrated Digital Systems, Inc. (Manassas, VA).&nbsp; The software includes many other useful

and unique features that strengthen performance planning, budgeting, management

and accountability in federal agencies, in addition to its ability to bring

performance-related transparency to Recovery Act spending.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information see <a href="http://www.strategisys.com/software.html">www.strategisys.com/software.html</a>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>CASCADE™ provides exactly the type of operational

transparency and accountability that President Obama has called for, that

federal managers need, and that the American public deserves.</p>

<h1>
				Tracking through Google Earth and web cam
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>An opportunity exists to expand Recovery.gov into a site that enables citizens to track recovery projects and how their money is being spent, and does so in an engaging way that encourages citizen participation, and hopefully rallies consumer confidence and enthusiasm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This idea involves posting ARRA stimulus projects on Google Earth so that people can sort and view projects by location, size or type.&nbsp; They could then ‘fly’ to the project location and see a graphic simulation of the project; read about the project (goals, costs, jobs created, timelines, org charts, project plans) and track progress visually through Earthcam or project specific web camera; meet the project manager and get updates; watch people working; find out if jobs are available; get links to job training programs etc.&nbsp; Scientific research projects could ‘fly’ people into a lab where the scientist would present his/her thesis, discuss the research and status of the research, and ultimately present the results.&nbsp; Clean energy projects could tour entrepreneurial companies engaged in solar, wind, clean coal, algae, electric cars – generating enthusiasm for what’s coming, and possibly even investment interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This vision obviously involves Google Earth, Recovery.gov, Earthcam or web camera network, and possibly the engagement of an army of citizen volunteers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementation would involve the addition of a line item in the communications segment of every project plan.&nbsp; The manager would submit basic project information related to location, costs, jobs, project plan, org chart for posting on the Google Earth ‘Recovery’ layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A working group would categorize projects as they are approved, and recommend how they should be presented.&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category A - important, high visibility projects such as infrastructure projects - light rail, highways and bridges, energy projects – smart grid and wind farms, and environmental restoration are longer term and lend themselves to graphic simulation, and on-site video and tracking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category B - large, high priority projects such as 21<sup>st</sup> century classrooms, and computerized health records are not solely geographic, and don’t lend themselves to weekly tracking but do lend themselves to visual example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category C - Big ideas for multiple small projects that create many jobs and should be implemented everywhere such as home weatherization, and Infrastructure repairs and upgrades, would show a generalized how to video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category D - Major Research and Development programs that lend themselves educational video, or tours of innovative, entrepreneurial companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category E - Equipment purchases that can be shown by photo record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category F - Training and jobs programs could be plotted locally, but also linked to like projects nationwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All projects would be posted on Google Earth in a special Recovery.gov layer and identified by&nbsp;&nbsp; placemarks – state or agency designated ARRA logo. Each site would be linked to the required contracts, invoices, payroll data etc. on their respective state, and agency sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain key projects could be assigned to a group of creative and technical professionals who would develop additional 3D SketchUps to simulate e.g. light rail routes, new bridges, green buildings.&nbsp; The group could even encourage submissions from job applicants as part of an ‘Apprenticeship’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Citizen volunteers could be engaged to conduct interviews with project managers, take videos, set up web cams, and monitor and promote interest in projects locally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Links existing technology programs and networks to turn Recovery.gov into a picture window through which citizens can view stimulus projects and monitor the expenditure and use of recovery funds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leverages technology to create jobs and volunteer opportunities, and catalyzes active citizenship and private public sector partnerships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creates a virtual 21<sup>st</sup> Century Classroom that uses technology and geography to expose and educate people about the ‘work’ of the nation, and links them to the resources they’ll need to participate.</p>

<h1>
				Add Mapping and Geographic Analysis to Recovery.gov
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Mapping and Geographic Analysis capabilities would enable Recovery.gov to provide a “full picture” of stimulus spending as envisioned by American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maps supported by a Geographic Information System (GIS) would enable people to see, understand, evaluate, and give feedback on government decisions. They would show where ARRA spending is actually taking place and enable evaluation of intended outcomes of investments in local communities. This would require data about the location of investment spending as well as analysis capabilities that link stimulus funding to socio-economic and demographic data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery.gov should provide information and interpretive maps as well as underlying data and online tools for working with this data. &nbsp;The underlying GIS needs to be based on open standards (i.e., IT, Web and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards) to enable citizens and government to utilize the broadest possible geospatial analytic and mapping capabilities to track and understand ARRA stimulus spending and outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Specifically</strong>, we recommend the following to enhance transparency:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to select and view maps of the data provided by government agencies</strong>— This capability would be supported by an underlying Recovery.gov geographic information system, enabling the creation, storage, and maintenance of data, the database, and a library of maps showing basic ARRA fund distribution and status. These data would be directly supplied by government agencies.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to analyze performance spatially</strong>— The site should support an easy-to-use capability for geographic data analysis and visualization. Recovery.gov should be able to integrate, analyze, and display location-related information from various sources including Internet geospatial Web services encompassing spending information and performance measurement data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to create and share maps</strong>— This capability would allow citizens to easily and dynamically create maps of any recovery data at any scale: national, regional, local, neighborhoods, etc. This capability would support posting, discovery, and viewing of citizen-created maps. These maps should also support various types of analysis (i.e., time, project, and performance measurement). The site would support creation of standard maps by anyone using map templates. This would allow the same geographic data to be reviewed over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to contribute comments</strong>— This capability would enable citizens to submit comments, photos, and other information about projects (i.e., schedules, performance and benefits, problems, etc.) linked to the maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to summarize spending and other data by geographic areas</strong>— Citizens should be able to summarize projects and expenditure data by zip codes, counties, congressional districts, states, or other user-defined geographic areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to download data and project information</strong>— Recovery.gov should support the ability of citizens to download any dataset for specific geographic locations for use and analysis using their own analysis and mapping tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other recommendations:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable Recovery.gov administrators to perform integration and quality assurance of data from multiple sources</strong>— Recovery.gov will integrate an enormous amount of federal and state information. This information will need to be retrieved and brought together with systematic workflows that ensure quality as well as timely dissemination. We encourage the use of proven professional GIS technology and talent for the design and management of this system.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Require ARRA fund recipients to report specific geographic locations of all projects and expenditures</strong>— The government should specify that all reporting agencies provide x,y location data to support the Recovery.gov data model/format and enable geography-based analysis and mapping.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Employ phased implementation approach</strong>— We recommend a phased approach for implementation of GIS for Recovery.gov. This would involve a basic capability implemented in a few months with improvements after 6 months, and a full IT system deployment in 12-18 months.&nbsp; Early phases would involve integration and services whereas later phases would involve directly connecting with a distributed data and reporting system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the capabilities we recommend are already implemented on a number of state Web sites including</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State of Maryland <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mdimap.com/statestat/">StateStat</a></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State of Oregon <a class="external-link" href="http://www.oregon.gov/recovery/StimulusReporting/index.shtml">Tracking the Dollars</a></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State of Washington <a class="external-link" href="http://www.recovery.wa.gov/map/default.asp#">Stimulus Reporting Map</a></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the other capabilities discussed here have been implemented in non-stimulus related applications by organizations across the country across the web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Maps communicate. Spatial analysis reveals insights and understanding. GIS provides the platform for both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve transparency and accountability you must be able to understand the raw data and analyze it in context with other relevant data. Using GIS to spatially enable, manage and analyze the stimulus data allows us to go beyond massive tables of data and simple dots on maps to begin to measure performance and evaluate accountability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make ARRA funds relevant to citizens you need to keep it local. To spatially analyze investment activities and their impact in the community and show it on a map requires a robust GIS foundation.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><strong>CertiClear Job Counter</strong> [<a class="external-link" href="http://jobcounter.certiclear.com">http://jobcounter.certiclear.com]</a> is a “shovel ready,” job counting application that is easy-to-use, easy-to-integrate into existing software and inexpensive. Agencies subscribe to the hosted service with a low-cost fee and user license and no cost need be passed on to the prime or sub-recipients. If requested, the Software may be installed behind firewalls. Agencies have real time views of information and seamless reporting capabilities.<br /><br />The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends continuing “efforts to identify methodologies that can be used to determine jobs created and retained from projects funded by the Recovery Act.” [<a class="external-link" href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-580">http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-580</a>]<br /><br />Job Counter assures real people in real jobs are being counted accurately, preventing inaccurate “guesstimates” by recipients, or the use of “phantom” employees by fraudulent businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />CertiClear Job Counter is an IT solution that should be required by Recovery.gov and adopted by agencies to:<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide consistent data collection <br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reduce fraud, waste and abuse <br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide greater transparency as to actual jobs created and retained</p>
<p>CertiClear (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.certiclear.com/">http://www.certiclear.com/)</a> modified existing patent-pending technology to build Job Counter because&nbsp; government agencies have the same goals as taxpayers: to assure transparency and accountability and avoid fraud, waste and abuse of Recovery funds.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>According to an April 23rd letter from Vice President Biden to Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will be issuing updated guidance in early May to address concerns of state and local officials. One of those areas:<br /><em>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A standard procedure for recipients to calculate jobs created</em><br /><br />Job Counter provides the “standard procedure” by gathering the data elements identified in the OMB guidance document of April 3, 2009 (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/memoranda_fy2009/m09-15.pdf">M-09-10</a>).&nbsp; Recipients can begin today meeting all the Reporting Requirements (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.smartpdf.com/register/2009/Mar/31/14639A.pdf">Section 1512 of the Recovery Act</a>) of the Interim FAR Rules, which have data reporting requirements retroactive to March 31, 2009. Job Counter collects all of the required data elements through simple uploads or easy online forms, limiting the administrative burden on recipients.<br /><br />Job Counter will help reduce fraud, waste and abuse because it provides for a level of assurance that recipients are hiring real people. The jobs data collected is auditable information to assure validity, but not of a confidential nature. At no time is private information reported or confidentiality breached.<br /><br /></p>

<h1>
				Add National Online Mapping to Recovery.gov
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<strong>Add National Online Mapping to Recovery.gov</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advent of online data and mapping, provides Recovery.gov (and the federal government itself) with a unique opportunity to take advantage of platforms that are fast, efficient, cost effective and accessible. Just under a year ago, we launched a national data warehouse and mapping tool – <a class="external-link" href="http://www.policymap.com/">http://www.policymap.com/</a> – to provide users with online access to data, maps, tables and reports in a sophisticated yet easy to use web platform. Based on that experience, we have some thoughts and examples on what the Recovery.gov data and mapping application should provide to the public so that the result is not just a high-quality visual display of information, but an underlying searchable database of information for the government and the public. We’ve started to map stimulu transportation investments in most of the MidAtantic states on PolicyMap and hope to post a link to those later this week – in the meantime, check out some of our current work to see what we are talking about.</p>
<p>We would recommend that any platform used by Recovery.org to make stimulus investments transparent to the public possess, at a minimum, the following abilities:</p>
<p>1. Recovery.gov’s database and mapping platform should be a <strong>national online platform</strong>that allows users to see stimulus investments in a standardized way throughout the county. States have begun to create their own websites showcasing their investments (which is great), but they appear in different formats. Some have pdfs listing their investments, others have begun to create state maps showing investment dollars, and still others offer a series of tables showing investments by county. As these sites proliferate, it will become difficult to compare information across important planning geographies (like MSAs) or by type of investment. <strong>Creating a uniform format and then providing states and grantees with the ability to load their investment data directly into a single national platform</strong> will allow stimulus dollars investments to be both transparent to the public and easy to analyze across geographies and investment types.</p>
<p>2. Once loaded, individual stimulus investments should appear as clickable points or shapes in a fast, online map. The mapping component needs to be able to display the exact locations of investments (points or shapes) so that people can zoom into a neighborhood or city or MSA and see EXACTLY where the money is going. <strong>The mapping needs to show not just where the money went, but for what purpose, how much and to whom.</strong> And the location on the map should provide a link back to the agency that received the funds. <strong>The public needs an online interactive map to see where investments have been made in their city, neighborhood, block or next door. </strong>For an example , this link shows investments at the neighborhood levels on an interactive map. You can zoom, pan, and search for locations and click on any point to read the details of the investments.</p>
<ol></ol>
<a title="Investments at a neighborhood level" href="http://www.policymap.com//map?o=80150&amp;ofilters=&amp;cx=-75.23246613559377&amp;cy=39.9779166915507&amp;cz=13&amp;iwx=39.9754&amp;iwy=-75.2365&amp;iwtype=identify&amp;iwtab=0&amp;cx=-75.23246613559377&amp;cy=39.9779166915507&amp;cz=13" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i675.photobucket.com/albums/vv118/PolicyMap/IDBubble.jpg" alt="Investments at the neighborhood level" height="267" width="400" /></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The online mapping platform also needs to <strong>house information beyond just the locations of the stimulus investments.</strong> Federal dollars allocated to communities through the stimulus (or even other federal programs) should be a part of the platform and displayed thematically. Users should be able to simply <strong>mouse over any geography in the nation to see how much federal money they are getting.</strong> They should be able to overlay the stimulus site investments themselves to then see exactly where that money went within one integrated platform. For an example this link shows a map of Earned Income Tax Credit received by zip code in 2006.</p>
<a title="EITC by Zip Code" href="http://www.policymap.com//map?p=676150&amp;i=9586270&amp;btd=8&amp;period=2006&amp;ofilters=&amp;cx=-75.24831695636732&amp;cy=39.99192722412711&amp;cz=10&amp;iwx=39.97444464140758&amp;iwy=-75.26423195050432&amp;iwtype=identify&amp;iwtab=0&amp;cx=-75.24831695636732&amp;cy=39.99192722412711&amp;cz=10" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i675.photobucket.com/albums/vv118/PolicyMap/ExpandEITC.jpg" alt="EITC by zip code" height="253" width="400" /></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. When it comes to any conversation about <strong>investments in “place”, the need for accurate, relevant and timely information about neighborhoods, cities, metro areas, and states is essential</strong>. The government is a repository of great public data; information about unemployment from BLS, tax return data from t<strong>he IRS, population characteristics from the Census and many other statistics are regularly</strong> collected and freely available. By incorporating this type of information in the online platform, users can see on a map not just where dollars directed at creating new jobs have gone, but see what the unemployment rate is in that area; users can see not just where homes are receiving weatherization assistance, but what the average age of a home is in that area, etc. This capacity gives the Recovery.gov site the potential to become <strong>not just a place for the presentation of data, but as an underlying tool for evaluating the impact of investments.</strong> This map shows an investment at a specific place layered over the vacancy rate. Combining context data layers is necessary to diagnose need and measure the effect of recovery dollars.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.policymap.com//map?p=866356&amp;i=9631212&amp;btd=6&amp;o=80150&amp;period=2008q4&amp;ofilters=&amp;cx=-75.23246613559377&amp;cy=39.9779166915507&amp;cz=13&amp;iwx=39.9754&amp;iwy=-75.2365&amp;iwtype=identify&amp;iwtab=0&amp;cx=-75.23246613559377&amp;cy=39.9779166915507&amp;cz=13"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i675.photobucket.com/albums/vv118/PolicyMap/ExpandVacancy.jpg" alt="Residential Vacancy Data" height="259" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>5. The platform must be searchable by the public. While Recovery.gov will need to display a series of pre-drawn tables and graphs that help to visually display where stimulus dollars are being allocated, <strong>the underlying online database platform must be searchable by the public</strong>. As states and grantees upload their investments information into the single online platform, <strong>users should be able to quickly download a list of investments meeting any number of criteria so a whole range of questions can be answered on the fly.</strong> From “How many energy investments have been made as a part of the stimulus in my city compared to another city?” “How have stimulus dollars been allocated by congressional district?” “What are the education investments being made in my neighborhood being used for?” Making information accessible and making information usable are two different things. The stimulus investment reporting must allow citizens to interact with the data in useful ways to answer questions about their communities.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Recovery.gov needs to pursue a solution that provides the public with detailed information about the use of stimulus dollars in a single national web platform that can generate easy-to-understand visuals like maps and tables - &nbsp;as well as sophisticated reports and analysis.</p>
<p>Adoption of an online platform also provides the federal government with a unique opportunity to take this all a step further and create - in one, single place - a repository of cross-silo, public data that can be used to:</p>
<p>1) provide the public with free access to public data;</p>
<p>2) evaluate how communities are changing over time as a result of stimulus investments; and</p>
<p>3) open up GIS data for local communities as they consider where future investments make sense.</p>
<p>Online data and mapping capacities give the government an opportunity to do this quickly and cost-effectively.&nbsp; The tools have already been developed and are ready to use in applications like PolicyMap.com.</p>

<p>Save money. Avoid getting tied up with commercial vendors and licenses. Extend "community developed" concept of recovery.gov to the tools that support the site. Prove value of open source solutions to government requirements in general. Provide additional assurance to public that analyses are sound, i.e. others will be able to independently replicate results using the same software in a controlled environment.

				Enhanced Analysis and Visualization
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>An idea for both the topic listed above and some of the earlier suggestions about enhanced visualizations and analytics, I'd like to submit an example of some of the options that should be pursued.&nbsp; We generally find that the approaches that often fail in data management and analysis&nbsp;are too many lists, spreadsheets, and columns of data.&nbsp; By using interactive visualizations, providing different levels of aggregation, and giving more in-depth analysis only where desired, you can turn volumes of data into usable information.&nbsp; We've taken the data at Recovery.gov (up to and including the Financial and Activity Reports added last week (dated 4/17/09) and created an interactive, dynamic dashboard of all of the data.&nbsp; In this way, you can do some top-level analysis, comparing agencies to each other and looking at the program as a whole, but also look at the individual agency over time.&nbsp; Take a look at it and let us know what you think.&nbsp; Link: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.microstrategy.com/recovery-act-data/">http://www.microstrategy.com/recovery-act-data/</a></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>We believe the pages within&nbsp;RECOVERY.GOV should provide the end users with at least this level of interactivity and functionality, so that citizens can perform all the analysis they desire in an easy-to-understand and easy-to-use way.</p>

<h1>
				Open Data Will Enable Democratized Analysis and Accountability
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Focus on making the data available rather than the analysis.</p>
<p>In order to meet the goal of open data, the government should look to create data portals using technologies with wide market adoption, like XML-based web services. Web services such as SOAP and REST are self- documenting, quick, platform-independent, and currently allow for the most flexible access to the data in question.&nbsp; Third parties will make the most interesting use of the data. If a site like Recovery.org focuses on providing Open Data (timely, raw, and technologically neutral), it will leverage the passion and creativity of the populace to ensure real transparency and accountability.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>As a software architecture specialist with 15 years experience building information systems for large customers including federal agencies such as the Department of Treasury, OMB, the US Navy, the CIA and OPIC, I can assure you that that the biggest challenge with this exercise will not be the format or operating system, but rather the volume of data and complexity of providing it in real time without straining the underlying infrastructure or creating privacy risks.&nbsp; The identification, provision and documentation of query tables (revealing whatever data the government intends to share) is the most basic first step.</p>
<p>Speaking at a technology event in Northern Virginia, newly appointed National CIO Vivek Kundra agreed that open data is the key, saying he was "deeply committed to opening up data to make it machine readable and easier for people to use/mix/mash." The real creativity will come from passionate citizens and organizations that will follow specific aspects of government regulation, and government spending.&nbsp; Similar to other public private partnerships, citizens and organizations will combine government data with outside sources (mash-ups) to produce useful tools that enhance our lives. A quick review of projects that have already been created from simple data dumps show just how much creativity exists.&nbsp; For example, <a href="http://www.OpenRegs.com">www.OpenRegs.com</a> is a website that taps into data underpinning the Federal Register and allows individuals and organizations to have a real-time look at the regulations that will affect them.</p>
<p>The infinite manifestations of data suggest that the worst thing the government could do is to try and anticipate all potential uses of the data by attempting to implement some grand master system. As Kundra also said, "technology changes so fast that by the time one standard comes along, there's another, and another, which is why government can't lock-in on one standard.”&nbsp; There will be lag time between the release of the data and the availability of functional reports but it’s nothing compared the delays inherent in a monolithic and over debated central system. Never was the KISS Principle more relevant.</p>
<p>Start simple, make the data available. I think we’ll all be amazed at the results.</p>

<h1>
				Single Reporting system for grants using BPM
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The federal agencies should provide one single system that will track grants from the moment they are awarded and allow the grantees and sub grantees to be able to report back through that tracking system.</p>
<p>While this concept may seem impossible to traditional grants management IT folks, the technology is readily available and can be implemented very quickly. The technology is Business Process Management (BPM). The leading BPM vendor, Appian Corporation, can implement such as system in a matter of months with effective security to ensure data integrity. Appian does that for the USArmy now with 2 million users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The idea is important because: 1) six months from now when grantees are expected to report back on performance and ROI on the investment from these grants, there is going to be very wide discrepancy between what the federal agencies report and what the grantees report. This is due to the lack of standardization and mechanisms available to the grantees and the sub grantees; 2) there is currently no single reporting system available that all grantees and sub grantees can afford; 3) the federal agencies would save millions of dollars in reconciliation expenses</p>

<p>CapEx Manager is a market tested solutions that will allow the Federal Government to reach its goal of full transparency and accountability as the&nbsp;American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is carried out across the county. The software will allow each participating organization to effectively manage day-to-day operations throughout their entire Program Lifecycle.&nbsp; Data flows seamlessly between each phase of the program, from bid preparation, to procurement, through&nbsp;project management, to project closeout.&nbsp;The system enables issues to be managed and resolved as they surface, information to be viewed,&nbsp;and costs and schedules&nbsp;to be controlled.&nbsp; Through the course of each project, the public entity responsible for the project, the federal government, and citizens will have real-time views on how their project is progressing, where issues exist and what is being done to&nbsp;make certain the project is being delivered in an appropriate manner.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This type of solution is extremely important.&nbsp; As identified by the act itself, there is a requirement for full transparency of all expenditures of dollars that fund this initiative.&nbsp; Taxpayers be able to know how, when, and where there tax dollars are being spent.&nbsp; Those spending the dollars should also have the tools to adequately manage the projects being funded.</p>

				8th Grade Basal Reading Level of Data Aggregation in Visual form
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>To meet the fundamental goals of a publicly accessible and understandable forum for Recovery.gov as a place where the public can monitor the expenditure and use of recovery funds data must be presented in a format keyed to the average reading level (ca. 8th), and further aggregated in an overtly simplistic way through a declining funds remaining bar, with a national and state based navigation interface.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The vast majority of the public relies on news agency data aggregation because 20 (small local level) page excel printouts are too complex.&nbsp; On a state level, the budget may exceed 400 pages, and on a federal level the budget easily exceeds 20,000 line-item pages of payees.</p>
<p>to be "transparent and publicly accessible" the page needs a simple interface, on the main page, with a declining fund bar (perhaps "cute") and a image hotmap allowing the public to key into local areas of interest to see how funds are being distributed in relevant agencies that affect their life.</p>
<p>What currently exists is woefully inadequate, nontransparent, obfuscated, and currently disappointing.</p>
<p>This should not require billions to implement, and should be no more complicated than the websites that presidential candidates would display to convey information and financial information/fundraising progress.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>My vision is that the federal government would provide a SaaS based solution that would automate the process of becoming a secure provider of Web Services or Web Applications.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Service would provide a self registration for federal agencies, state and local, and other government entities allowing the web administrators the ability to produce a compliance report for their web site or service.&nbsp; This service would scan their applications for malware, vulnerabilities, standard IA best practices, audit for compliance measures like Privacy impact assessments, section 508, and site quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once registered the users can use the site on a periodic basis to reassess their level of compliance as well as leverage the services documentation, policy, and best practices as guidelines to bring the same testing standards in house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a clean assessment is complete the users of the service can download a seal of approval or certificate stating they completed the federal compliance audit using the service.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the service lives on vulnerability checks will be updated with the latest risks and policies, IA guidelines can be matured to meet the most recent assessment criteria and the users of the service can re-assess their applications.</p>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>More and more our own federal websites are contributing to the global spread of malware, spyware and other types of computer based threats to our national security.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are immediately attributed to theft of identities, consumer data, corporate theft, and classified content.&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to take immediate action to address these issues with education, enablement, and technology with a strong commitment to improving the governmental web that we rely on more and more every day.</p>
<p>Current practices like FISMA can be dramatically more effective with the assistance of automated testing and assessment tools like the service I have described.&nbsp;&nbsp; Making what was once a paper pushing exercise, a dynamic integrated part of the application life cycle.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Mandate the use of a construction project management system by all recipients of Recovery Act infrastructure related funds. This ensures the information reported to Recovery.gov isn’t just project “information” but information we can all trust.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Construction project management systems are forward facing “systems of record” which provide the scope, schedule and budget details required to run a portfolio of infrastructure related projects.</p>
<p>The systems include standard, configurable reports providing transparency so all fund beneficiaries are known clearly, accurately and immediately upon contract award. They can track any goals or targets desired including jobs created per project and provide program and project status reports upon request or to public websites such as Recovery.gov.</p>
<p>Construction project management systems protect the validity of the information they manage through security and audible activity logs so every bit of information can be tracked and verified before it’s reported on. After all, most organizations managing large construction projects use these systems today for business critical decisions and compliance reporting. In fact, this is technology which the federal government already owns and just needs wider implementation.</p>
<p>There are many excellent ideas on this site which address the presentation and communication of information, but the most critical component to the Recovery Act program is transparency and accountability of our tax dollars being allocated, committed and spent and the associated results. Implementing a construction project management system enforces procedures and processes associated with contracting, change management, invoicing, competitive bids and field reporting so consumers of Recovery.gov information can trust the information on the site.</p>

				Federal Government Telecommuting Boondoggle
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>There exists in the federal government a program called telecommuting. Telecommuting is an agreement between federal unions and the federal government where the federal employee works at home from 1 day to 4 days a week. The problem with federal agency telecommuting is that there is no accountability for work done at home. Government management does not require a deliverable when a federal employee returns from working at home. Many perform there duties at work and claim that they accomplished a task at home when in reality they are having a 4 day weekend. How do they do this? Well they work 3 days a week for 10 hours a day. Then they claim to work 10 hours at home. So, the federal employee is at his or her duty station beginning on Tuesday and ending on Thursday. There are some cases where federal employees work 3 days at home and work 1 day a week at their duty station. One federal worker asked a guy who was telecommuting what he thought. The telecommuting federal employee stated, “it’s a boondoggle”. The taxpayer should not have to pay 40 hours a week for 30 hours of pay. This is a travesty. There must be accountability! If you work at home for 10 hours a day on taxpayer dollars then you must show a deliverable, work accomplished! How to enforce this is a matter of discussion, but make no mistake about it there needs to be a plan in place that corrects telecommuting boondoggles for the taxpayer is paying federal employees for an extended weekend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>It is a manner that answers the question? Is actual work being performed by federal employees at work while they telecommute. A deliverable is paramount for federal employees who work at home or for that manner any telecommuter. Accountability must be implemented otherwise telecommuting is denied.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Had this idea while resopnding to another idea;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a growing tendency for people to focus on phrases or ideas like make data available via "SOAP, or XML formats".</p>
<p>What should really happen is less a focus on _HOW_ data is delivered

(although that's an important followup) and for politicians and data savvy people

to talk about _WHAT_ is delivered.</p>
<p>e.g. I want to see a spec that says "Every gov. entity at a

department accounting level needs to show year-to-year operating costs,

total headcount, and break out spending for services (internal vs.

eternal) and operation costs (energy, fleet and fuel)"</p>
<p>Something like that with probably more detail like "calculate these

numbers with such-and-such methodology and you must also report the

Standard Deviation".</p>
<p>The "HOW" should be a small footnote, e.g.</p>
<p>"This data should be made available 16+ hrs a day including the hours of 9-5, 7 days a week via multiple formats including but not limited to XML and JSON"</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Going forward consistency on the metrics seems more important then consistency in the format. Computers and programmers are great at munging data that's available in many formats.</p>
<p>However, if one department spending # is calculated differently then another department's, then no amount of WSDL, SOAP, XML or JSON will help.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>1. While the recovery act is understood by some, it needs more clarity in its terms.</p>
<p>The following terms need to be clearly defined on the Recovery.gov site.&nbsp; These terms need a very simple 6th grade-level definition, a high-school-level definition, and a technical or college-level definition, each with examples or descriptions to ensure that the diverse audience has a shared understanding of the ARRA intent and mechanisms.</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Recovery</li><li>Reinvestment</li><li>Transparency</li><li>Accountability</li><li>Openness</li><li>Strategic</li><li>Oversight</li><li>private sector</li><li>public sector</li><li>fraud</li><li>waste</li><li>abuse</li><li>mismanagement</li></ul>
<p>The terms fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement need to be especially well defined, as well as why the ARRA is seeking to prevent them by taking actions to ensure that their opposite behaviors (antonyms) take place within the ARRA implementation, tracking, and reporting.&nbsp; See the table below.</p>
<table class="MsoNormalTable">

<p>Opposite of Mismanagement = Management comprises directing and controlling a group of one or more people or entities for the purpose of coordinating and harmonizing that group towards accomplishing a goal. Management often encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources, and natural resources. (See Wikipedia)</p>

<p>Due to the multiple areas of crisis facing our country and the world, we need (across all aspects of the ARRA as well as across all aspects of our Governments, Commercial Organizations, Non-Profit Organizations,, Volunteer Organizations, diverse groups, and individuals) a means to keep our terms clearly defined, understood and consistently applied.&nbsp; We need a "National Recovery, Capabilities, Operations, and Governance Terminology" (See Wikipedia for explanation of Terminology).&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many open-source and commercial technologies and approaches that can built various terminologies having different capabilities.&nbsp; However, this suggested National Terminology more than simple lexicons, glossaries, and dictionaries.&nbsp; A terminology is a rich, meaning-focused, structured arrangement of terms, their meanings, and how they relate to each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A terminology, when well-developed and shared, provides a means to translate the jargon that often makes it difficult for one person, group, or organization to accurately communicate with another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A terminology can enable all participants in an effort to know and validate each other’s meaning, understand and operate well with shared processes and rules, and understand the data and information from the effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terminology is an implementation of "semantics".&nbsp; I suggest we use a public domain approach like that at <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/one-world-is.org/gem-ema/Home/gem-approach/gem-metamodel"><u>http://sites.google.com/a/one-world-is.org/gem-ema/Home/gem-approach/gem-metamodel</u></a> as a starting method for developing this shared National Terminology to enable better, faster, and cheaper capabilities, operations, and governance across the country.</p>
<p>2. There also needs to be communication about previous U.S. Government actions to reduce Fraud, Waste, Abuse, and Mismanagement within the Federal Government and by those who receive Federal funds.&nbsp; This is the same reason that the Recovery Accountability and Transparency (RAT) Board is comprised of Inspectors General (IG).</p>
<p><strong>Federal Laws Established to combat fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. Public Law&nbsp; = P.L., Executive Order = E.O., Title and Code = Rules</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.L. 95-452, the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended [Title 5 United States Code (U.S.C.), App. 3], which sets forth authority and functions of the Inspector General.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.L. 101-12, Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, which strengthens the protection available to Federal employees against prohibited personnel practices.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1010, Conduct of Employees, which requires an employee to report fraud, waste, abuse, and corruption in Federal programs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Title 18 U.S.C., Crimes and Criminal Procedures, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which prescribes rules that govern all criminal procedures in the Federal courts of the United States.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.O. 12731, “Principles of Ethical Conduct for Government Officers and Employees,” dated 10-17-90, which establishes the requirement for Government employees to disclose fraud, waste, abuse, and corruption.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.L. 110-409, Inspector General Reform Act of 2008</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.L. 111-5, February 17, 2009.American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act)</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The standing organization by which IG's across the government collaborate is the <strong>Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE). (see <a href="http://www.ignet.gov/"><u>http://www.ignet.gov</u></a>)&nbsp; Quoted from that site: </strong></p>
<p>"In October 2008, the President’s Counsel on Integrity and Efficiency previously established under Executive Order was abolished and replaced by provisions of the Inspector General Reform Act (Act). The Act established a new entity, the <strong>Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE)</strong>, which is an interagency council headed by a Chairperson, an Inspector General and an Executive Chairperson, the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The CIGIE is composed of presidentially and agency-head appointed Inspectors General, respectively, with a mission to address integrity, economy and effectiveness issues that transcend individual government agencies and to increase the professionalism and effectiveness of personnel by developing policies, standards, and approaches to aid in the establishment of a well trained and highly skilled workforce in the Offices of the Inspector General.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Functions and Duties of the Council include:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Continually identify, review, and discuss areas of weakness and vulnerability in Federal programs and operations with respect to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement; </li><li>Develop plans for coordinated, government-wide activities that address fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement and promote economy and efficiency in Federal programs and operations. These plans include interagency and inter-entity audit, investigations and evaluation programs and projects to deal efficiently and effectively with those problems concerning fraud and waste that exceed the capability or jurisdiction of an individual agency; </li><li>Develop policies that will aid in the maintenance of a corps of well-trained and highly skilled OIG personnel; </li><li>Maintain one or more training academies for the professional training of auditors, investigators, inspectors, evaluators, and other OIG personnel; </li><li>Submit recommendations of individuals to the appropriate appointing authority to fill Inspector General vacancies, and </li><li>Maintain an Integrity Committee to receive, review and refer for investigation allegations of wrongdoing that are made against Inspectors General and staff members. </li></ul>
<p>All of these responsibilities to prevent mismanagement, and thus reduce the likelihood of abuse or waste of Federal resources, or fraud involving Federal Resources, exist for all Federal activities, including the new ARRA.&nbsp; This needs to be emphasized, especially the role that the current administration's drive towards "transparency" in making this long standing requirement for stewards' accountability more visible to those who own the resources under their stewardship.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; National Management Methodology is needed.</p>
<p>The "Rational Thought Process" described by Norman V. Peale is paraphrased as: "knowing where you are, knowing where you want to go, and knowing how to get there".&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Path = interdependent transition plans.&nbsp; </li><li>Destination = To-Be state.&nbsp; </li><li>Starting Point = As-Is state.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>You don't necessarily need to know much detail about the starting point - you do need to know enough about what needs to change (i.e., gap, deficiency, shortcoming, overlap awareness).&nbsp; Customers are the best sources of this information, i.e., customers of each outward-facing value-chain and each internal value-stream.</p>
<p>I use the following simplified definition of "management": resolving natural and continuous disorder into intended order.&nbsp; Another way of expressing what management consists of is:&nbsp; knowing your Current (As-Is) state, knowing your intended (To-Be) state, and building, implementing, and adjusting transition plans to achieve your intended state by intentionally changing your current state.&nbsp; Wikipedia's definition elaborates on this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any management repository (e.g., an extension of an enterprise architecture (EA) repository), must have a metamodel that can capture the steps and details of the management life cycle methodology followed by the organization and its participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is no cohesive, coherent, and consistent management life cycle methodology applied by the organization and all of its parts, then the organization is operating in a non-rational, fragmented/partial/compartmented, wandering, impulsive, non-ordered manner.&nbsp; This sounds like insanity as a worst case, or aggressively acting in ignorance as a best case!&nbsp; Since educated management knows this, acting without a common management life cycle approach is mismanagement in any case, which opens up increased probability of waste, abuse, and fraud in every case.</p>
<p>So, if you don't have continuously refreshed knowledge, through a shared terminology, of your current As-Is state, haven’t specified and continually updated your To-Be state, and continually created, refined, and priority-sorted your plans to transition from As-Is to ToBe states, then any changes being pursued are wild, uncontrolled, lunges by leaders and managers towards shiny new things - i.e., the absence of management, i.e., mismanagement.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>If we don't have a common terminology (terms, definitions, concept maps, taxonomy, thesaurus, ontology, axiology) then we very likely to not understand each other, and very likely to hide information, thereby making mismanagement likely, thereby making waste, abuse, and fraud more likely.</p>
<p>We all need to recognize that the ARRA is giving increase transparency over long-standing law, orders, and rules that apply management controls to all Federal efforts and resources, including those funded through the ARRA.&nbsp; Inspector Generals in all Federal Agencies and their other government, commercial, and non-profit counterparts, have clearly defined and long-standing responsibilities for ensuring adequate control of Federal Resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organization Owners/Citizens/Investors, Boards/Legislatures, Executives, Managers, and Workforce all have responsibilities to establish and comply with those controls.&nbsp; Positions that have the duty and authority to look across all elements of an Organization's staff and subordinate organizations (e.g., Chiefs of Staff, Deputies for Administration) are typically those most likely to ensure controls exist and are enforced, and therefore would pass the scrutiny of the IGs and auditors</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Making stimulus spending data accessible to the public
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Federal agencies as well as recipients of stimulus money are required to report certain spending and performance data for aggregation on Recovery.gov. This mandate provides an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability over investment of stimulus dollars. It also provides agencies with a complex new reporting requirement that must be rolled out fairly quickly.</p>
<p>To meet the accountability and transparency objectives of the Act, agencies and prime recipients must have the ability to provide ARRA-mandated reports meeting the following criteria:</p>
<ul><li>Provided in a timely and accurate manner</li><li>Accessible to the public and searchable (discoverable) using readily available search technologies</li><li>Published in a structured format (as opposed to unstructured text formats) to facilitate value-added data aggregation and analysis</li></ul>
<p>The easiest way to accomplish this with the least amount of risk is to implement a distributed reporting architecture leveraging widely available Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) - based web standards and technologies such as extensible markup language (XML), Really Simple Syndication (RSS), Atom, extensible hypertext markup language (XHTML), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Comma-separated values (CSV), keyhole markup language for geo-encoding&nbsp;(KML), representational state transfer (REST), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and other modern data access standards.&nbsp; In this scenario, agencies and prime recipients would perform the following actions:</p>
<ul><li>Extract ARRA-mandated data elements from relevant backoffice systems (e.g., financial management systems, grants management systems, etc.) using an appropriate data access application programming interface (API) (e.g., JDBC)</li><li>Transform those data elements into ARRA – mandated reports such as funding notification reports, periodic financial reports, and award-level reporting</li><li>Publish ARRA – mandated reports to the Web as "data feeds" using one or more of the aforementioned formats as appropriate. Once published to the web, these feeds could then be combined in value-added ways using “mash-ups,” a popular state-of-the-art web development technique.&nbsp; They can also be harvested and aggregated by Recovery.gov.</li><li>Provide a "sitemap" using the popular Sitemaps standard (<a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/">http://www.sitemaps.org/</a>) to make it easy for subscribers to find all of your feeds </li></ul>
<p>Once these remote data feeds have been published, the Recovery.gov website can aggregate them on an ongoing basis using readily available "spider" or web crawler technology.&nbsp; The "spider" essentially visits each data feed on a regular, ongoing basis, checks it for changes, parses it, and posts it to a local index or data mart.&nbsp; This index is then used by Recovery.gov as a data store to allow the public to search and perform analytics on stimulus spending.</p>
<p>There are numerous readily available technologies, both commercial and open source, to implement the features described in this article.&nbsp; For example, Unisys has developed a Recovery Act reporting solution that can extract ARRA data elements from their host systems, aggregate them into ARRA-mandated reports, and publish those reports to the web as RSS / Atom feeds, KML feeds for geospatial visualization, CSV for spreadsheet integration, and custom XML vocabularies for integration with other applications. The Unisys Recovery Act reporting solution was developed using various open source enterprise Java technologies, and will integrate with most Government web hosting environments.</p>

<h1>
				Establish A National Terminology As A Shared Reference
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Provide a National Terminology as a shared reference for all Federal Activities and for all those receiving Federal Funds.&nbsp; A&nbsp;full terminology would consist of a series of information structures built in layers.&nbsp; These semantic layers, from foundation to top, are:</p>
<ol start="1"><li><em>Creation of Content by authors.</em> </li><li><em>Inventory of content</em> stores (operational structured content as data, analytical structured content as data, semistructured content such as email, and unstructured content such as documents, spreadsheets, and presentation files) </li><li><em>Term extraction</em> from content, tied to source and author metadata </li><li><em>Term definition</em>(s) from authors, groups, organizations, standards-bodies, national and global dictionaries, etc. </li><li><em>Concept maps</em> as Directed Labeled Graphs (<em>DLG</em>) with underlying <em>triples</em>, as <em>concepts of operation,</em>&nbsp;<em>conceptual data models, or OV2</em>&nbsp;(Expandible to <em>logical&nbsp;data models</em> in <strong>ERD </strong>or ORM format and <strong>physical data models</strong> in <em>DDL</em>, <em>XML/XSD</em>, <em>RDF/RDFS</em>, or <em>OWL</em>. Further expandible to <em>ontologies and knowledge-bases</em> using RDF/RDFS or OWL (with an <em>Enterprise Architecture</em> metamodel being anontology and the EA content being a knowledge-base).&nbsp; Further elaborating the ontology or EA would then lead to the ability to build an <em>axiology</em> showing&nbsp;subject-activity sequences, and thus subject-activity dependencies, and thus subject-activity <em>value-streams, value-chains, and priorities</em>.&nbsp; (All of DODAF fits here, and some of OMB FEA) </li><li><em>Taxonomies</em> to categorize broader and narrower meanings and their terms&nbsp; (and to serve as master-metadata and master-data for organization-wide lookup tables) (Some of OMB FEA fits here) </li><li><em>Thesaurus</em> for identifying preferred and alternate terms within a domain, including acronyms, aliases, abbreviations, and alternate spellings, all as a means to <em>translate jargon across domains</em> and <em>translate&nbsp;across natural languages</em>. </li><li><em>Refinement</em> of terminology by cycling from item 1 back to item 7.</li></ol>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>A shared and governed terminology would dramatically reduce the complexity and cost of accurately interfacing cultures, organizations, workforces, processes, data, and technologies.&nbsp; If built from the top of a domain, it is less costly and more effective than building from the bottom up.</p>

				Enforce Americans With Disabilities Act
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Eliminate each and every concern that a disabled person fears in losing benefits, when attempting to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using and Internet Connection virtually anyone can contribute to the economy, Technology is already available that could make it possible for disabled persons to work from the homes. The Americans with Disabilities Act can be enforced if the burden of accommodating the special needs of a disabled person in the normal office environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost of transporting the disabled person from home to work is the second costly deterrent making it nearly impossible for a handicapped person to a place of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most Americans with disabilities could do some work but cannot control when and how much they can contribute due to the many health related factors that prevent them from pursuing gainful employment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only realistic solution is to identify jobs within the national economy that would be done on a flex-time schedule, from home, via a network and PC. Some of the jobs include: Call Center Agents, Data Processing, Medical Transcription, Teaching and Consulting in areas the disabled person might be knowledgeable in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tax breaks already exist for employers who wish to employ the disabled. However, the vast majority of employers can not create a workspace to accommodate, and have little or no education about their rights and responsibilities of employing the disabled. It is easier to just not get involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simple Solutions-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educate employers about their responsibilities and options under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensure that no disabled person will face losing benefits for making an attempt to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Offer genuine opportunities through an online job bank listing openings of flex time, tele-commuting employment.

<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restore the self-esteem of the disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep it simple and keep it away from the states. Federal Programs work, State Programs have not.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>According the the Social Security Administration 3 out of every 10 gainfully employed persons working today, will become disabled before reaching the age of 55.</p>
<p>This resprsent millions of valuable human resources, and billions of dollars of money being directed into many different programs that only reach a token fraction of the disabled community. Aside from direct benefits, most of this money is being spent on social workers and other beaucrats who contribute little or nothing to actually effecting the lives of the dibbled and their families.</p>

<p>Before you look into tooling it is critical to understand the methodologies

rather than the tooling initially. you want to make sure you tooling

infrastructure will be flexible and scalable for future needs.</p>
<p>An example would be SNIA standards, www.snia.org, more specifically SNIA's

SMI-S, XAM, and Cloud Storage Standards.</p>
<p>As an example the Storage Management Initiative Specification (SMI-S) was

designed to collect, monitor and provision heterogeneous network environments

using standards. More importantly, this allows multi vendor support, a plug and

play methodology where interoperability is key to minimizing software

development and understanding you have vendor choice.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				model local reporting process on online income tax sites
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>With April 15th still a recent memory, my suggestion is that the Recovery.gov reporting process mirror the process that on-line income tax reporting programs use (<a class="external-link" href="http://tinyurl.com/csvncr">Neal Hannon &amp; I explained this recently in a TechPresident op-ed</a>).</p>
<p>After all, many of those reporting on the expenditures will be small communities without a lot of staff ( even big communities may have lost a lot of their specialists who could do this function), Accordingly, the process must be designed so people with no special training or resources can still complete it quickly and accurately: that’s very similar to the challenge the online tax programs address.&nbsp; <br />Many of their features were designed to address parts of the tax filing process that directly parallel those facing reporting on stimulus spending:</p>
<ul><li>Don’t ask the recipients to make any calculations. Have the&nbsp; calculations run invisibly within the web site.</li><li>Instead, focus on designing a totally web –based process (so that you don’t have to worry about printed forms or government employees filling out traditional data files)</li><li>When you first log on to these tax sites, they ask you to provide some basic demographic information. That determines whether you fall into several classes where specific deductions might apply or additional information is needed. Since Recovery.gov must apply to every community from tiny ones to huge cities, it’s crucial to quickly assess&nbsp; what major categories a specific community may fall in (such as urban/rural, high unemployment/minorities/immigrants) so that the process can then automatically determine which categories are relevant and interactive processes to fill out each portion will be triggered.</li><li>Design the process so&nbsp; data entered locally is automatically&nbsp; augmented, or “tagged” with meta-data (“information about information’), using a structured data format such as <a class="external-link" href="http://www.xbrl.org/WhatIsXBRL/">XBRL, the eXtensible Business Reporting Language</a> . Once a specific piece of data has been entered into the reporting system and is tagged, it becomes what you might call a “data nugget,” with context and meaning garnered from the metadata. The data lives not as a form, but as information accessible by any computer program that can “call” or retrieve the data. On the Federal level, the FDIC already uses this approach to capture quarterly information from the nation’s more than 8,000 financial institutions.</li><li>Again, similar to the online tax programs, use the full range of Web 2.0 tools to guide those filling out the reports&nbsp; -- brief videos, reading the exact wording of the tax code, using&nbsp; wizard processes that guide you through the process, and (a recent addition) also let you pose a question to online users (via a wiki) who might be able to clarify the answer for you. The combination of all these tools acknowledges that we each have different learning styles and ways of processing information.</li><li>Finally, these programs run you through a final review and error catching process, based in part on whether your answers are exceptions to widespread norms (that doesn’t mean that the answers are necessarily wrong, just that they deserve more scrutiny on your part because IRS reviewers are also likely to scrutinize them more carefully). Why not a Recovery.gov variation on the theme?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>A lot of time and planning has gone into technology for the Recovery.gov website, where all of the reports on stimulus spending will be aggregated.</p>
<p>However, the biggest potential for errors is at the beginning of the process, when recipient communities have to report how they spent the money and the results. If those numbers are off, every succeeding step in the process will be skewed. Doing everything possible to reduce the chance of error is vital.</p>
<p>Online tax programs only ask for data, and automatically generate forms based on that data: the user doesn't have to make any calculations, reducing the risk of error. Likewise, an entity reporting stimulus spending in a rules-based format need not worry about anything but accurate data inputs. Reporting can be automated at the recovery.gov website.</p>
<p>A data-centric approach from start to finish in Recovery.gov is critically important. Collecting accurate data, as opposed to paper-based reports, provides increased accuracy and flexibility in both the collection of data and the reporting of the data. . If structured data is used, it could be accessed both instantly and simultaneously by a number of government agencies and externally by the public to assure accountability and transparency.</p>
<p>It could also be the model for a unified reporting process so that communities and states would be able to file a single data file, which, because it would consist of structured data, could be accessed simultaneously and instantly by every agency, both cutting reporting costs significantly and allowing simultaneous review by multiple agencies. Such a system,,<a class="external-link" href="http://tinyurl.com/cbmnj7"> the Dutch Taxonomy Project</a>, is already in place in the Netherlands.<br /><br />Online sites have radically streamlined the 1040 preparation process for many Americans. A parallel, cloud-based reporting system capitalizing on the many years of experience with the online tax preparation process could help Recovery.gov simplify the stimulus reporting process, capture structured data “nuggets” that could also be used in a variety of other reports, and significantly improve the accuracy of the stimulus reporting process.<br /><br /></p>

				Federal Performance Management Solution
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The ARRA guidance requires capture of performance milestones from the agencies (program plans) and requires that prime recipients of ARRA funds submit quarterly performance and spending reports. &nbsp;The solution could go a few steps further to morph into a Federal Performance Management Solution that stores all agency performance plan milestones, and requires that Federal agencies report how all contract and grant solicitations will help achieve the agency performance milestones. Then, when the awards of contracts and grants are made, the recipients of those contracts and grants can report progress that then can roll up to the agency's larger performance milestones. &nbsp;The end result would be performance reporting for all federal expenditures that would include all agencies, their performance milestones, how those milestones are supported by contracts and grants, and whether the recipients are performing in fulfillment of the agency milestones. &nbsp;This could easily be expended from ARRA related spending to all federal contracts and grant spending.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>A Federal Performance Management Solution would fully achieve the Administration's open government and transparency agenda from the perspective of spending accountability and performance traceability. &nbsp;This solution would extend the agenda originally articulated in FFATA to include full traceability back to agency performance milestones. &nbsp;This solution will benefit the public by showing how agency spending supports the larger agency milestones and how the recipients of contract and grant funds are acting in alignment with the agency strategy and milestones.</p>

				Using alerts and notifications to provide timely problem detection
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>One of the key benefits of data transparency is the ability to "crowdsource" the watchdog function - i.e., give millions of citizens the tools they need to mine information about stimulus spending (e.g., Recovery.gov), and they will raise an alarm if they see any potential mismanagement of taxpayers' dollars.<br /><br />However, even with unprecedented data transparency and sophisticated data analysis / visualization tools, there is still the possibility that instances of irregular spending will "fall through the cracks" given the sheer volume of data.&nbsp; And, as we all know, the longer a problem goes undetected, the harder it is to fix it when it is finally found out.<br /><br />A way to solve this problem is through implementation of a rules-based system of "alerts and notifications." This system would alert agency officials and any other interested party to any stimulus spending occurring outside the bounds of established parameters.&nbsp; The rules for generating an alert/notification would be tied to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) derived from accountability scorecards of the type described in my previous article located at http://www.thenationaldialogue.org/ideas/using-balanced-scorecards-for-performance-based-analytics . For example, an alert could be raised if a prime recipient reported excessive spending as compared to an associated KPI such as cost-per-job-created. <br /><br />Alerts and notifications can be provided to subscribers using various methods:&nbsp; RSS and Atom feeds, email notifications, automated telephony systems, and text messages, to name a few.&nbsp; A key benefit of having a system of alerts and notifications in place is more "proactive management of risk." In other words, oversight officials become aware of, and then can address,&nbsp; problem areas before they become front page news stories.<br /><br />There are numerous technologies, both commercial and open source, that can be used to implement the "alerts and notifications" features described in this article. For example, Unisys has developed a Recovery Act reporting solution that implements a system of alerts and notifications tied to its four different types of "accountability scorecards." The Unisys Recovery Act reporting solution was developed using various open source technologies, and is designed to integrate well with Government web hosting environments.</p>

			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Migrate recovery.gov into a true portal structure, with information resources identified as such, and allow users to create their own interface to these resources, available either via the web or handheld device. Users should be able to create profiles containing which information resources they wish to see, and manipulate those profiles to show those resources in the manner best suited to each user.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>As information produced by agencies, states OMB, and fund recipients continues to grow, centrally organizing, managing and presenting that information to a disparate user base will become more and more challenging and time consuming. Developing and implementing standards such as XML for some of the data to be collated helps, but when there exists so much data in other formats from other sources (RSS feeds, excel reporting sheets, structured databases, web page updates, etc.), consumers of that data are faced with a nightmare of finding, and then staying abreast of changes to particular information that interests them.</p>
<p>Treating each area of information as a source of data, and then allowing users to be able to select which sources they wish to see, and the manner in which they see them, will engage more users and offer them more meaningful use of the data that interests them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery.gov should be a poster child of the modern IT solution.&nbsp; This would include 100% virtualized computing resources that are out sourced to an industry leader in providing commercial companies “cloud” services.&nbsp; This will allow a cost competitive solution based solely on the solution and not on the acquisition, initial, support, and other elements inherent in a asset ownership model – this amounts to up to a 50% reduction in operating costs including the initial startup.&nbsp; The cloud has the added benefit in increasing the platform availability, and allow flexible and right sizing of the solution without buying or decommission hardware assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Cloud solution has the added benefit in being GREEN – as there is an estimated 60% reduction in hardware costs and power usage.&nbsp; The net effect of this is a reduction in the carbon footprint and power consumed in a datacenter.&nbsp;</p>

				Use semantic technology to link data.gov and recovery.gov resources
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Use semantic web technologies to expose metadata and structure of information to link data on recovery.gov with information shared through data.gov.&nbsp;<br /><br />The first level win is to accelerate the process of providing raw data, via a RSS feed. This implies a restful API plus providing definition of the data elements and structure so that people know what they are getting. Semantic web technologies are preferable to XML and microformats for this because they are designed to share and expose definitions of tags as well as data, and to map different sets of tags (i.e., schemas or ontologies) with eachother<br /><br />The second level win is to provide a solution for <strong>semantic publishing</strong> of information (e.g. data, text, tables, graphics, imagery) tagged and linked for both human and machine interpretation. For example, the Statistical Abstract is a report, well curated, and with a lot of data tables, etc. and also, well thought out metadata, and statistical methodologies about how the data are derived, etc. Making information in recovery.gov and data.gov available for both human and machine processing / interpretation implies being able to expose the concepts and structure of the different kinds of information linked to an underlying ontology. First step might be to post the content in a web 2.0 wiki and upload documents and data sets for downloading. The next step would be to expose the structure / semantics of this information using semantic web technologies. Plus, it is always wise to engage the people who publish the information to help with the modeling. All doable today.<br /><br />—<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The third level win is to use semantic metadata and modeling to facilitate data mash-up of different information from different sources:<br /><br />(a) In some cases this is relatively easy to do with web 2.0 techniques. Someone accesses a couple of RSS feeds, and combines these with other data and web services. The mash-up maker resolves any semantic issues as part of creating the mash-up.<br /><br />(b) In other cases, a new use of information can take advantage of the curation and semantic data linkages that some agency, or other party has already provided and expressed as ontology, making it possible to establish user interface features that allow for do-it-yourself exploration and conversations with data.<br /><br />(c) In still other cases, the alignment of concepts and resolution of intents, definitional and methodological issues across data will require additional effort.<br /><br />Obviously, you go for the low hanging fruit first.</span></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>We are moving into an era where we will expect to access and interrelate all information in the internet information by concepts, not just by artifacts and hard coded structures. While it is possible to use XML syntax to identify concepts in hierarchies, assuming we all use the same tags in the same way, this is not adequate for representing and reasoning over the diversity of structured data, documents, and web content. Simple solutions are great. But, we also need an approach that can scale, handle complexity, and can adapt and evolve easily as needs change. Semantic web technology provides a better choice for this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is critical that a solution dealing with data on the scale required for supporting ARRA should have all the proper underlying technology to ensure that the meaning of the data can be recognized and properly utilized.&nbsp; This brings context to the analytics and real value to the metrics that have been collected.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Myself, along with many other partially disabled veterans or citizens who are unable to work in an office invironment and concerned about the environment, want and need jobs from home. We are able to help in many ways by tele-commute. My idea is to reach out to those concerned citizens, give them jobs in monitoring and oversite of the funds that are available through this recovery act.</p>

<h1>
				Use managed spreadsheets for local agency reporting
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Allow agencies to report information in the data environment they know best (ie. Excel spreadsheets). When they are received at Recovery.gov they&nbsp;will be&nbsp;processed through a spreadsheet management system. This is a standard off-the-shelf software product, with proven scalability across large complex organisations and easily capable of handling millions of spreadsheets.</p>
<p>The processing of the spreadsheet information&nbsp;into a data warehouse provides many benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Complete data transparency</strong>, visibility and analysis right down to a cell level - across&nbsp;successive spreadsheet versions and between the submissions of different agencies.</p>
<p>Fraud and error detection - robust central monitoring ensures that anomalies and improper behaviour can be rapidly highlighted without significant manual effort.</p>
<p>High reporting flexibility to address the wide variety of requirements that will exist on day 1 but can adapt as new needs develop. This applies to both reporting into Recovery.gov and reporting from Recovery.gov to its stakeholders</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>All new data collection processes start with spreadsheets because they are low cost, familiar, flexible and fast. Migration to more formal applications requires time, for design, specification, build, rollout and user training.&nbsp;Recovery&nbsp;is too urgent to go through such normal IT cycles.</p>
<p>Using spreadsheet management as a data collection and warehousing prcess&nbsp;enjoys the advantage that all the required user knowledge already exists in the wide population and no new technology needs to be externally deployed.</p>
<p>The technology for data extraction, validation, warehousing and reporting on 'who, what, why and&nbsp;where' only needs to be present in the central locations ensuring a rapid, easy deployment. Dashboard information of all critical information and performane&nbsp;measures&nbsp;can be broadcast through many existing technologies including web pages. Agencies can get on with the business of leading recovery, not stuck in IT projects.</p>

				Use Annual Imagery to Track Success (IFTN)
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p class="section1">Everyone in the world understands before and after images.&nbsp;Elected office holders, citizens, agencies and news media can drown in a sea of tabular information, but a picture is worth a thousand words in any language. A national program of annual imagery, combined with geospatial data about where stimulus funds are spent, could clearly show progress over time in the rebuilding of our national infrastructure. And it would allow citizens to check on the progress of local projects.</p>
<p class="section1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="section1">For example, recovery funds were provided to&nbsp;the government of Hometown, USA for a new bridge.&nbsp; Two years later, new imagery shows the completed bridge and taxpayers from around the nation, and not just from Hometown,&nbsp;can see&nbsp;the benefits of their investment. Or they might spot a place where&nbsp;no work&nbsp;has&nbsp;been done.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Little Red Elementary School, in Hometown, gets recovery funds to install solar&nbsp;panels, the next year's imagery could reveal those panels up on the roof.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the state gets recovery funds to widen two miles of highway that lead to Hometown, a future&nbsp;aerial photo shows the highway has been widened, and&nbsp;folks can measure the new lanes.</p>
<p class="section1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="section1">The state of Arkansas has demonstrated how regular acquired imagery can quickly show a project's progress. Images over time from the area of Little Rock redeveloped for the Clinton Presidential Library offer a prime example. The images are part of a slide show presentation found at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qVct_RjdCU"><u>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qVct_RjdCU</u></a>.</p>
<p class="section1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="section1">And, while no shovels are involved, the nation is ready right now to start collecting imagery each year. The states, federal government, and private sector have come together to develop a national program, "Imagery for the Nation. It simply needs to be funded (See <a href="http://www.nsgic.org/hottopics/imageryforthenation.cfm"><u>http://www.nsgic.org/hottopics/imageryforthenation.cfm</u></a>).</p>
<p class="section1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="section1">Finally, imagery collected on an annual cycle has inherent value beyond&nbsp;the tracking&nbsp;of recovery investments.&nbsp; It can be used for public, private and non-profit decision making,&nbsp;to help save lives,&nbsp;to showcase economic development opportunities, and&nbsp;to record the history of our land.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Everyone in the world understands before and after images.</p>
<p>A national program of annual imagery, combined with geospatial data about where stimulus funds are spent, could clearly show progress over time in the rebuilding of our national infrastructure.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Rcovery.gov contains far more data than can be easily managed or understood by simply visiting the site. &nbsp;Semantic lens technology allows people to combine data of their choosing with widgets of their choosing to work with the data they need in the view they want.

				Contractor Tracking and Oversight
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Implementing a universal system to track all federal employees (civil servants and contractors) for time and activity planning and tracking. The system already exists! By simply requiring contractor employees to utilize the&nbsp;time and attendance software already in place, the government&nbsp;would be able to&nbsp;count, account for, and tie to budget their contractor community&nbsp;as they currently do for their civil servants.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The government currently has no way to accurately quantify how many contractors are employed, what programs, projects, and activities they are working on, and to tie them to their budgets. Instead of establishing separate data collection, analysis,and reporting solutions, extending the use of software already implemented ensures success in addressing the contractor oversight issue. The added benefit is timely and accurate actual, certified, validated data instead of estimated, calculated, or survey-generated information. Since this data would be updated at least every federal pay period, it would be available real time, unlike contractor invoice timeframes requiring reconciliation or solving disputes.</p>

<p>PPM tools have a proven track record and can successfully:&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Provide for central collection of all data elements required by the Recovery Act;</li><li>Provide an easy way to collect the required information directly from the recipients of the stimulus funds, and integrate data reporting into the day-to-day activities of the stimulus projects.</li><li>Provide for accurate data visualization of national, state, regional, and local stimulus-related information through the effective use of graphs, charts, and tables; and</li><li>Provide the ability to implement and integrate new data reporting requirements as needed.</li></ol>
<p>PPM tools will provide Recovery.gov with a "shovel-ready" solution to the enormous challenge of providing the public with accurate, consistent, and complete data related to the spending of stimulus funds.&nbsp; Additionally, these automated tools will ensure an unprecedented degree of accuracy and transparency, providing a model for the improvement of other government database systems.&nbsp;</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The taxpayers are in need of clear, concise and accurate reporting.&nbsp;One&nbsp;of the leading web sites for reporting stimulus dollars is hosted by the City of New York. This web site called <a class="external-link" href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/ops/nycstim/html/tracker/infrastructure.shtml">NYCStat</a>&nbsp;gives taxpayers a clear view into what is being spent, how much is being spent and where it&nbsp;is being spent. You can drill in to a program and clearly see&nbsp;what the&nbsp;programs status is at any point in time.&nbsp;This is a simple way to let taxpayers see projects that impact their local and identify project status. In addition, another way for a taxpayer get access to project details and status is to allow them to&nbsp;drill into a&nbsp;state, then in to the county or&nbsp;city. There are numerous ways to integrate geospatial data with project/program data.&nbsp;Incorporating geospatial data provides a rich interface to program and project data.&nbsp;</p>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>

				Location Schema- Enables Data Analysis and Visualization 
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The National States Geographic Information Council (NSGIC) applauds the focus in this Dialogue on using data visualization tools such as maps -- and the GIS tools that make geospatial data useful to the public as maps and other information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We offer a few thoughts on how to make sure that we make the best use of geospatial data and GIS to ensure the citizens have complete information on where and how their dollars are spent. The most critical step that must be taken is to provide a standard, nationally consistent approach to tracking where stimulus funds are spent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest a hierarchy of commonly used geospatial location attributes that can be used to mark discrete points, collections of points, or areas in which funds are spent:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Latitude/Longitude -- For spending tied to a particular spot or point feature</li><li>Mileposts (Linear Referencing) -- For spending on transportation infrastructure</li><li>Address -- For spending tied to a particular building</li><li>Unique Parcel Identification Number -- For spending tied to&nbsp;a particular property</li><li>Census Blocks/Block Groups/Tracts -- For spending in a geographic area</li><li>Zip Code --&nbsp;For spending in a slightly larger geographic area</li><li>Legislative District (State or Congressional) -- For spending in an even&nbsp;larger geographic area</li><li>City/County/State -- For spending in general within a defined administrative boundary</li></ul>
<p>Establishing a common ‘location schema’ is critical.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>A common location schema, understood and used by all reporting&nbsp;ARRA funds;&nbsp;will be required in order to obtain the integration with the visualization tools proposed.</p>

				Simple Way To ReduceFraud -- Non-Obvious Relationship Awareness
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The Recovery Board should look to leverage cutting edge tools that provide "Non-Obvious Relationshiop" capabiltiies designed specifically for reducing fraud and waste -- These tools will help the Board identify "Who's Who, and Who Know's Who" with a high degree of precision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In many of the conversations that we at IBM are having across Federal Agencies and State &amp; Local government, leaders are telling us they are facing&nbsp;intensifying fraud challenges that are fast outstripping their capabilty to respond.</p>
<p>While the the types of fraud are wide and varied, two examples are -- 1) one individual of business entity submitting the same grant proposal multiple times, across multiple agencies, using he same or slightly different indentification attributes, and 2) The proposal "reviewer/approver" sharing the same address, phone number or other identifying information with the "proposer".</p>
<p>The good news is that the Recovery Board will be collecting an granular level of data&nbsp;on who is actually recieving Recovery Act investments, and how the dollars will be spent.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this level of data lies the opportunity&nbsp;for&nbsp;the board to&nbsp;develop a capability for &nbsp;"Non-Obvious Relationship Awareness" or NORA.&nbsp; This capability would provide the Identity &amp; Relationship resolution -- spotting common or similar addresses, phone numbers, etc, across multiple entities and identities -- thus allowing them to eliminate double dipping or conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<ul><li>Given the unprecedented level of investment the Recovery Act wiull bring to bear, it also presents the Board and the taxpayer with the potential for an unprecedented level of Fraud and Waste.&nbsp;&nbsp; If only 1% of the investment is lost to fraud -- a low number given historical averages for government programs -- <strong><em>the taxpayer will lose close to $8B to fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong></li><li>The capability for "Non Obvious Relationship Awareness" now exists, and is currently being used across the Federal Gov't in both social service and DHS/DOD agencies.</li><li>IBM provides these capabilities as a component of its "InfoSphere" suite, through its InfoSphere Entity Analytics&nbsp;Solutions (EAS)&nbsp; InfoSphere is an industry unique, unified platform for delivering trusted information.</li><li>IBM acquire NORA capability thrugh the acquisition of two small, best of breed SW companues. </li><li>As a part of this platform, Recovery.gov can leverage the same tools it would use for data quality, consistency and accuracy to reduce fraud.&nbsp; This extends the value proposition of any investment in these tools.</li><li>More information on InfoSphere and IBM Threat &amp; Fraud Intelligence can be found here:</li></ul>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The current charts/graphs featured on the recovery.gov home page are awful. I know you guys have spoken with Edward Tufte some (pro bono on his part), but I'd like you to engage someone more like Stephen Few (I have NO affiliation with Stephen Few or Perceptual Edge, other than being a fan of his work). 95% of the information people want can best be represented with some flavor of a line chart (including sparklines) or a bar chart (including bullet graphs). And, it can be done while minimizing the data-pixel ratio. There is GOOD information out there on best practices, and that will go a <em>long</em> way to not only "providing the data" but "providing information."</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Most of the people who will visit recovery.gov will underestimate the complexity of the underlying data. That's just the way data works. At the same time, most of the people who are collecting/aggregating the data are analytically-oriented, and most of the people who are doing web design are design-oriented. To effectively provide meaningful data-based information, these two disciplines have to be married together. There are a handful of basic principles required to do this effectively, and the current site is not demonstrating an understanding of those principles -- either on the home page or in the various .csv files that are available further down in the site. Without effectively <em>presenting</em> the information to the public, this entire exercise is for nought.</p>

				eGovernment Internal Web-Services Utilization
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to maximize efficiencies through the utilization of recovery expenditures (or&nbsp;eGovernment&nbsp;efficiencies in general,)&nbsp;the internal technology leveraged by the government for managing the expenditures and the technology leveraged for transparent public-facing reporting of&nbsp;expenditures should utilize the same web-services&nbsp;structures and implementations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, don't build two systems; instead configure a single implementation to meet numerous simultaneous needs.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dramatically-increasing role of government in managing the recovery expenditures comes with great risk for misperceptions and decreased trust. By leveraging a common-services approach, this risk can be mitigated through the transparency of &nbsp;"one-stop-shop" web-services where government manages programmatic expenditures and the public receives recovery progress reporting and expenditure updates.</p>

<p>Any IT solution must ensure the privacy and security of data.&nbsp; This is what consumers expect and what our government promises. Because numerous federal and state laws require government to maintain both the confidentiality and the protection of certain data, any IT solution for Recovery.gov must be "government ready" by these criteria.&nbsp; Ensuring the privacy and security of data will increase consumer confidence and trust in the way data is handled by government and non-government actors alike.&nbsp; We cannot gamble public trust on IT solutions that have an&nbsp; open door to bad actors.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I recommend a user-frienddly ARRA DSS (Decision Support System) for ARRA data and business analysis and data integrity. I have already built a "PROTOTYPE"&nbsp;&nbsp;system using data from <a href="http://www.recovery.gov">www.recovery.gov</a> and USAspending.gov. This is based on Vapsoft software which I designed. Very user-friendly and end-user computing tools. I would like to offer a demo to your team. My power-point-based material was submitted to Mr.&nbsp;Dan Germain, Project Diretor. Also some of output reports were published in my website: <a href="http://www.nonprofitsdata.com/1J_ARRA.htm">http://www.nonprofitsdata.com/1J_ARRA.htm</a>. Please review this site. &nbsp;These types of reports will be generated online by the ARRA end-users. I would like to present a demo via WexEx or remote access method. I would like to build a "PROTOTYPE" application free of charge if you provide Excel-based ARRA data.&nbsp; Vapsoft is my copyrighted software and very powerful end-user computing software tool. This software will be excellent solutions for ARRA decision support process. I will send&nbsp;my Powerpoint materials to you if I have your email addresses. I will present a demo to you any time when you are available. &nbsp;&nbsp;My contact info: David Yoo, Vapsoft &nbsp;<a href="mailto:dcyoo@msn.com">dcyoo@msn.com</a>&nbsp; 402-312-9740.

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>There are at least three&nbsp;categories of user&nbsp;involved in this system.</p>
<p>1) The entity that receives the funds</p>

<p>Any system implemented should have three "views" available, one which displays the data relevant to each category.&nbsp; As <a href="http://www.recovery.gov">www.recovery.gov</a> has been up and running for a while, it may be relevant to qualify the users as they enter that site as falling into one of those three categories, and track the usage of that site by category.</p>
<p>If you look at Facebook (which is the successful massively multiplayer web application of the moment), it does&nbsp;four things well.</p>
<p>1) Searching (keyword based auto complete based on user defined relevance, e.g. "friends" in Facebook)</p>
<p>2) Interactivity (ability for user to contribute to dialogue at anytime, and for dialogue to be seen for a while, it makes the user feel important, whether anyone actually reads the post or not)</p>
<p>3) Open Format (third party applications which allow the community itself to define what works and what does not, which raises replay value).</p>
<p>4) SIMPLICITY (the core application does not delve beyond the four or five basic things that it does well, and has enhanced the simplicity of those core functions over time).</p>
<p>This system should focus on core elements as well, if its intended audience is the American people.</p>

<h1>
				Organize Participation Through Coalescent Bubbling
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>My approach is to divide the "transparency" issue into two parts. <br /></p>
<p>1) <strong>Sunlight</strong>. This involves a commitment to better enabling&nbsp; public <em>reading</em>

of existing data. There's recently been lots of progress and that front. It means making information available in multiple

forms... pre-refined visualizations, raw formats that others can mashup

and refine, or some kind of semi-raw,&nbsp; and a standardized XML-ish

format that's easier to rewrap.&nbsp; But it raises the problem of which

sets of data are the most reliable and useful, which "answer" is most actionable, and which publication standard should be formally selected.<br /></p>
<p>2)&nbsp; <strong>Participation</strong>. This involves a commitment to allowing public <em>contributions</em> to the dialogue. It's the holy grail of online democracy, and seems to be one of the driving motivations of this "National Dialogue"site. "We" don't know how to organize the dialogue yet, but we know that the Web offers a tremendous opportunity to build great tools.</p>
<p>My recommended solution is a strategy called <em>coalescent bubbling</em>. It goes far beyond the tag-linking and Digg-like bubbling approach

they're encouraging here, by separating the nomination phase from the

voting phase, and then using interactive ballots with a ranked-choice voting system to build consensus outcomes. The upshot of coalescent bubbling is essentially a visualization of an Instant Runoff Vote.</p>
<p>See an example at <a class="external-link" href="http://www.choiceranker.com/election.php?eid=6">http://www.choiceranker.com/election.php?eid=6</a></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>If Govt 2.0 -styled mechanisms such as Online Town Halls are going to scale to serve the demands of large and actively-engaged populations, the new venues need to built around structures that can simultaneously capture and vet new ideas, and bubble up the good ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A system (like the one on this site) designed to float popular ideas "up,"&nbsp; based on a range of&nbsp; "Like" vs "Dislike" responses, is far from optimal. Popular ideas typically get checked out first, and then bubble up even faster. Voters tend to ignore potentially valuable latecomer contributions, leaving them ever farther behind.</p>
<p>Such Town Halls also need ways to channel "swarms" (online groups of voters and contributors organized around a single candidate or issue) without degrading or silencing them. People want to compel politicians and government officials to listen to their concerns and to respond to them (which is one of the reasons "Joe the Plumber" touched such a big nerve on the right). A legitimate online Town Hall worthy of the name would provide a reliable way for citizens to do so.&nbsp; But the officials also need ways to say, politely but truthfully, "I already answered that question at&nbsp; www.answered.here."</p>
<p>The next generation of ranked choice voting systems offers many advantages in solving these problems.</p>

<p>Why aren't you making it a priority to control the costs before you talk about the working people (who pay for it all by the way) and then talk about giving it when absolutly needed only...not free and all consuming like medicade and medicare are now. I have insurance through my husband and we pay out the hind end for it and keep paying.</p>

<p>Important because we don't want to pay more, we are paying enough now and it keeps goping up. Why should I pay more so that someone who isn't working and many who won't work have it at no cost....the hospitals are run amuck with taking advantage of this and the government just ignores the taxpaying working man.

<h1>
				Use of Business Process Management (BPM) Technology for Recovery Programs
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>At Oakbrook Solutions, we have teamed up with Appian Corporation out of Vienna, VA to leverage Enterprise Business Process Management (BPM)&nbsp;technology to provide process automation, management and accountability solutions for complex and changing processes in the Wealth and Investment Management Industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that the US Government has invested in economic recovery programs&nbsp;on behalf of the US taxpayer, we recommend a close look at properly applied BPM technology&nbsp;as a scalable platform that can provide the following:</p>
<ul><li>Rapid deployment of automated solutions to manage Economic Recovery Programs with no programming required (i.e. we built a prototype to manage the CPP application process using&nbsp;8 hours of a business analyst's time)</li><li>Ablity to tie together disparate data sources and organizational entities into a single integrated process</li><li>Complete visibility into the end-to-end process with full audit trail that drives process transparency and accountability.</li><li>Intuitive Workflow Design with integrated Business Rules architecture enables rapid deployment and facilitates ongoing change in a collaborative environment</li><li>Rich portal, content management, and user collaboration capabilites.&nbsp; Comprehensive drill-down dashboards created with no programming.&nbsp; Automated generation, storage, and version control of all documents associated a process.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<ul><li>The US Government needs a platform to enable rapid deployment and ongoing change of solutions to manage Economic Recovery programs.</li><li>The platform needs to enable process integration (both data integration and user&nbsp;interaction integration)&nbsp;among all organizational entities affiliated with a program.</li><li>The platform must enable complete process transparancy and accountability to satisfy ever changing requirements in a challenging economic and political environment.</li><li>Traditional&nbsp;software development efforts simply cannot keep up with the pace of change and deployment requirements mandated by&nbsp;these programs.</li></ul>
<p>BPM technology is built to provide these capabilities.&nbsp; Properly applied by financial services industry experts, a BPM-based solution would be an extremely effective and versatile platform that would serve as the&nbsp;backbone for the integrated automation, management, transparency, and compliance for&nbsp;the US Treasury's Economic Recovery programs.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it is easier to falsify purchases if you write a check than if you use a card.&nbsp; Using a stimulus debit card would allow greater tracking of the funds.&nbsp; The cards would have to be configured differently than debit cards, but the idea remains basically the same.</p>

				Social Media Tools for Local Government Reporting
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I am suggesting that guidance could be given to local government, perhaps even templates, for the use of social media to report recovery project information. I set up a quick example of how this could be accomplished for a fake project in a fake city using a fake contractor. You can find this example at <a class="external-link" href="http://recoveryprojectexample.blogspot.com/">Recovery Project Example.</a> (All info on this site has been set up only for the purpose of the demo although the Flickr photos are actual construction photos from my own stream, but used only to help illustrate the idea here.)</p>
<p>Most projects have similar events or steps that could easily be archived and reported in this manner. The idea is that all of this information is being generated anyway behind the scenes. Using social media just helps to get it in the hands of the public in an easy to access and potentially engaging format.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Social media tools offer the opportunity for distribution of real time

information, plus give the public the opportunity to provide feedback. This is important so that the public is kept up to date on project-related issues and information as soon as possible. Also, social media allows for dissemination of knowledge in an easy to understand format.</p>
<p>Also, the cost to implement this is minimal because the tools are open source or free, and the project team is already generating this information.</p>

<div>
<div>
<div>New semantic technology could establish applications and portals which help poeple to interact with governmental authorities more easy.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>People could be supported to find the right service for their request or a precise anwer for their question.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The citizen should start a process that keeps the user informed about the status and offers the oppotunity for querstions to a personal agent.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My company offers a middleware for the integration challanges and <strong>semantic interpretation of all the data to provide the right information in a given context,</strong> like a question, a requested service of a running process and even the peoples profile. The architecture is flexible to consider different data silos, security and privacy requirements and the management of terrabytes of data. The analytic approach is an automatic procedure to avoid huge investments in semantic data modelling.&nbsp;</div>

<p class="MsoPlainText">In an era where terms like efficiency, transparency, and collaboration are not just goals, but mandates under the Obama administration, having a powerful knowledge foundation and market-leading on demand customer relationship management (CRM) solution helps meet these objectives. &nbsp;Recovery.gov and U.S. Federal agencies can leverage a unified knowledge foundation to share, monitor, and collaborate on information, while providing transparent open communication between themselves and their constituents.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>
</strong><p><strong>Create a publicly accessible website that will allow end users to directly monitor and view energy consumption for homes and businesses. This could be viewed&nbsp;at an aggregate&nbsp;level by geographic region, by industry, sector, private homes&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; Alerts could be set for specific locations when thresholds are reached, either indicating excessive consumption or optimally efficient energy utilization.&nbsp; This could be displayed&nbsp;visually on web enabled maps with color coded pins that could be selected and drilled into.&nbsp; In addition, credits or incentives could be granted for consumers or producers that operate at maximum efficiency, or conversely&nbsp;identified for excessive consumption. This could be shown in comparison to the amount of stimulus received. </strong></p>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This idea would allow consumers and businesses to monitor their energy consumption and allow them to optimize usage along with getting credits in doing so.&nbsp;For businesses, stimulus funds could be compared to energy utilization.&nbsp;This information would be publicly available, so the news impact would be real-time.&nbsp; Researchers could access this information and monitor energy consumption as it occurs. Contests and rewards could be offered for optimally&nbsp;efficient behavior.&nbsp;</p>

				Adapt successful federal data exchange programs to ARRA recipient reporting
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>A key factor to&nbsp;enabling the public to monitor&nbsp;Recovery Act&nbsp;spending&nbsp;is to get accurate and timely&nbsp;reports from contract, grant and loan recipients in a format that is highly reusable on the web. This is a massive challenge, with&nbsp;tens of thousands of&nbsp;state and local government entities alone among the universe of potential recipients required to report to the federal government.</p>
<p>The good news is that the federal government has tackled similar reporting and compliance situations before -- in partnership with state and local governments -- and can adapt successful models to enable efficient and effective&nbsp;recipient reporting.</p>
<p>The federal government could&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://gcn.com/articles/2009/03/09/commentary-message-flows-are-paramount.aspx">build upon the successes of existing federal information exchange programs</a>,&nbsp; such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s Central Data Exchange (CDX). The idea is to adapt free open source data exchange tools that the government already uses for&nbsp;other mission purposes&nbsp;to aggregate and publish the required Recovery Act recipient data. <a class="external-link" href="http://xml.coverpages.org/epa-cdx.html">EPA's CDX </a>applies this approach with the help of open source gateway technology that helps states report data required by environmental regulations. This approach can be adjusted at relatively low cost to convey the data called for by the Recovery Act.</p>
<p>An April 15, 2009&nbsp;executive forum co-hosted by the CGI Initiative for Collaborative Government and George Mason University dove deeper on this topic. Featured speakers included:</p>
<ul><li>Kshemendra Paul, Federal Chief Architect at OMB’s Office of E-Government and IT, who is actively involved in establishing a central governmentwide system for Recovery Act reporting. </li><li>David McClure, Managing Vice President at Gartner Government Research, who has consulted with numerous federal, state, and local government executives about the Recovery Act. </li><li>Stan Czerwinski, Director of Strategic Issues at the General Accountability Office, who coordinates GAO’s work on stimulus programs. </li><li>Lisa Schlosser, Director of the Office of Information Collection at the&nbsp; Environmental Protection Agency, who heads up EPA’s collection of environmental data submissions from state and local governments. </li></ul>
<p>For top-of-mind takeaways from the April 15 session and other related postings, see the following links:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.collaborativegov.org">www.collaborativegov.org</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;fact that this approach&nbsp;is <a class="external-link" href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">open source </a>means it’s available to federal agencies, states and local governments to reuse to report and aggregate data from both very old and more modern systems.</p>
<p>This model could enable efficient quarterly recipient reporting of accurate project results for reuse and display on Recovery.gov. It also could offer at least three bonus benefits:</p>
<p>-First, it provides the ability to capture valuable data in a format that can be reused many ways for better decision-making –- both by citizens and government.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Second, it has high potential for reuse by states to help manage&nbsp;the challenge of sub-recipient reporting (for example, see <a href="http://www.cgi.com/recovery">www.cgi.com/recovery</a>).</p>
<p>–Third, it offers flexibility to change over time (as the meaning of “transparency” evolves).</p>

				Standards Always Win: An Enterprise Architecture Pattern for Transparency
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>To create a enterprise architecture pattern based upon well established industry best practices for the sharing of enterprise data across functional and organizational boundaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other industries have achieved, with great success, the standards process required to share fiscal data across enterprise boundaries.&nbsp; We have no need to reinvent the wheel with Recovery.Gov.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

We need to simply leverage the work already in place for the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.oagi.org">Open Applications Group</a>, <a class="external-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN/EDIFACT">UN/EDIFACT</a> and <a class="external-link" href="http://xbrl.org/">XBRL</a>
<p> working groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A significant amount of the data we require to provide true transparency lies deep within the Enterprise Resource Management systems deployed across State, Local and Federal agencies. To truly address the core issues of transparency we need to provide a standards based infrastructure to the seamless exchange fiscal data between all stakeholders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve this level of transparency we simply need to embrace and adhere to a small number of open standards.&nbsp; Foremost among them being the use of XBRL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a notional architecture for exchanging enterprise resource data across open internet standards in use by global supply chains today.</p>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>I'm not proposing a radical new infrastructure for transparency. Instead, I'm suggesting we simply leverage the current established standards in use for global commerce today.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>It has been proven time and again&nbsp;that data processing without a robust network will only lead to fragments and chaos.&nbsp; As the most powerful nation in the world, we need THE NETWORK&nbsp;to make information available and on demand to&nbsp;consumers who need it.&nbsp; This will open up all kinds of&nbsp;doors to accomplish what we really need to&nbsp;accomplish.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>If it can be known, take the amount of spending that goes into congressional districts, (updated over time), and divide it by the population of that district, (because populations of districts are not the same size from one state to another).&nbsp; Grade this spending per capita by color, green seems appropriate, on a map of the United States, a zoom in feature by region would also be nice.&nbsp;One map for all&nbsp;money coming&nbsp;into the district and one map for the stimulus money only.&nbsp; Also a map for&nbsp;the following countries&nbsp;taken each as a whole: Iraq, Afganistan, Isreal, Egypt, Haiti, Liberia.</p>
<p>The color gradiant would work like this, $0 would be&nbsp;white.&nbsp; The district with the absolute most spending would be a dark green.&nbsp; All the districts&nbsp;would have white mixed into the dark green as they compare to that most spending district.&nbsp; Say a district received 75% as much money as the most spent in district.&nbsp; Its color green would be 75% as deep, 75% dark green, 25% white.&nbsp;</p>

				A single solution.  Let's not try to bolt too many parts together.
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>With simplicity comes transparency.&nbsp; Just think how the government does things now.&nbsp; Not a single bill can be passed without the addition of some kind of pork brought about by a deal – nowhere near a simple transaction.&nbsp; The is our money and we need to be able to<em> easily</em> identify where every dollar was spent, <strong><em>including all of the side deals</em></strong> after the money is handed out.&nbsp; Simplicity guarantees that the user, any user, will be able to understand what they are seeing or what they want to see, without having to navigate though a labyrinth of poorly designed screens.&nbsp; Good software can do this – handle the complexity behind the scenes so that everything is simple to the end user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most importantly, we do not want to spend tens of millions of dollars building a system to do what is already commercially available off-the-shelf.&nbsp; Furthermore, the bulk of the stimulus money will be spent if we take the time to custom-build something, so that’s simply not an option</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that every dollar spent, every single dollar, must be supported by a contract.&nbsp; The true solution is to track the spend by contract at the receiving end.&nbsp; Every dollar passed to a state has to be documented, followed and available for reporting out of the OMB, and every dollar awarded on a contract by the state that received the money, must exactly balance the money granted by the OMB.&nbsp; Simple accounting.&nbsp; If it doesn’t balance, we’ll know about it instantly, through email or other kinds of alerts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ecteon has been installing contract management systems since the mid-80s.&nbsp; We have installations in federal and state government agencies.&nbsp; The system is ready to go to provide an audit trail of every dollar spent and alerts for any part of any contract spending.&nbsp; Ecteon is 100% American, based in New York; 100% of our employees are American and we do no offshoring of any kind.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ecteon.com">www.ecteon.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that there may be a naive impression that given the amount of transparency and accountability called for by this act, no or little fraud will occur. My 38 years of federal enforcement experience tells me that some level of waste and fraud is unfortunately inevitable," Mr. Devaney told state officials charged with coordinating the spending. - Washington Times, March 13, 2009</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our objective, which should also be yours is to prove Earl Devaney wrong - that we will track every dollar and if one goes unaccounted, we will immediately know where to look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The <em>complete</em> solution already exists, so we won't waste time and money writing a lot of custom code.</p>
<p>We won't have to bolt together a bunch of dissimilar systems to create a hybrid.</p>
<p>Everything will be on&nbsp;a central common database making analysis and reporting an easy task.</p>
<p>Its a <strong>100% American</strong> solution.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>			
			Use a Research Management Solution (RMS) to track the due diligence performed by the government agencies tasked with distributing stimulus funds. An RMS can systematically capture and organize the unstructured information required for the analysis of stimulus investments. RMS has been successfully adopted by money managers all over the globe as a way to create an open and transparent collaboration among analysts, power better choices for decision-makers, and create a structured audit trail of analysis.
			
			
			<h2>Why is it important?</h2>	
			99% of the world's information is unstructured: email correspondence, documents, spreadsheets, slide decks. While quantitative analysis is critical, many of the most important decisions are driven by human discourse – in words not just numbers. Research Management Solutions transform the cacophony of disparate email inboxes and shared drives into a structured database shared in real time across global organizations. To provide complete transparency for the public, the agencies responsible for application of stimulus funds need to track their internal assessments. These assessments will include large bodies of correspondence and prose analysis. Research Management Solutions can transform the potentially chaotic investment research process into a coherent, organized, and agency-wide effort.

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>We want recovery now: so we want more than concepts later, we want capability now.&nbsp; As agencies scramble to adapt spreadsheet and related systems to jury-rig a disparate variety of stove-piped Recovery Act tracking systems, in fact, a Web 2.0-based system&nbsp;ideal for exactly this purpose has been validated at NASA.&nbsp; Call it "the right time and the right place."&nbsp; NASA-sponsored technology may set the pace for how agencies can track Recovery Act money from spending to real results.&nbsp; Here is the background ... In 2008, I was asked to address a seminar for NASA managers on using Web 2.0 for business improvement.&nbsp; Cary Landis, seminar leader and&nbsp;CEO of Virtual Global Technologies, knew of my work in the corporate world, plus service at GAO and nearly a decade in the Executive Office of the President.&nbsp; (I served at OMB and later as team leader of the Science &amp; Technology Team for the National Performance Review Task Force. So I know something about real-world government spending, accountability and results.)&nbsp; Fortunately, our audience at the Glenn Research Center included managers who really "get it."&nbsp; The lunar project staff forged ahead with piloting and proving the TeamLeader (tm) performance management and reporting system.&nbsp; Based on Virtual Global's technology proven by organizations such as The Pampered Chef corporation and endorsed by the intelligence division of the Seattle Police Department, NASA's Web implementation proved so successful that Mark Hyatt from NASA's Advanced Capabilities Office was asked to&nbsp;present it in detail at the agency's annual "Management 2.0" conference this past Febuary 2009 in Florida.&nbsp; ( <a href="http://nasateam.com/uploads/casestudy.pdf">http://nasateam.com/uploads/casestudy.pdf</a>&nbsp;) The NASA configuration of TeamLeader (tm) can be rapidly customized for particular agencies and programs (the system's "toolset" cuts implementation time and costs by more than a quarter).&nbsp; Results can feed real-time into successive roll-ups at department and OMB levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a fully secure Web 2.0 system (it is the only system in the world that includes a breakthrough NIST patent for Role-Based Access Control), TeamLeader (tm) scales across all levels of government; can connect to pre-existing budget and management systems; can plug-into Google Maps and other capabilities; gives managers real project visibility; automatically "roles up" reports for review; and where appropriate, can help to automate Web publishing.&nbsp; John Hale - MINDWEST Strategies</p>

				Palantir: Technology to Empower people to Investigate and Prevent Fraud
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Please see <a href="http://www.palantirtech.com/videos/stimulus">this video Demonstration of our idea in practice</a>!</p>
<p>Investigators on the Recovery Act Accountability and Transparency Board (RAT Board) will need to draw on vast quantities of data while performing their duties to investigate and prevent fraud, waste and abuse in stimulus spending.  Since human resources are always limited it is important to empower analysts and investigators so that they can be effective as possible.  <a href="http://www.palantirtech.com">Palantir</a> enables analysts to rapidly visualize and understand the non-obvious relationships present in data to create a coherent and accurate view of the world.</p>
<p>Palantir has addressed the significant technology challenges that must be addressed before analysis can take place.  The stimulus data exists in a wide variety of locations and formats – both structured (database, xml, spreadsheets) and unstructured (free text) - and this data is arriving in real time.  Any meaningful analysis will take place in an integrated environment and allow investigators with different areas of specialization to collaborate in this constantly evolving space.  Palantir enables new data to be incorporated and integrated rapidly, without requiring all the data formats to be specified up front.  (Videos of our engineers talking about the technical challenges we’ve solved in detail, and how we solved them <a href="http://www.palantirtech.com/government/videos/whitevideos">can be found by following this link</a>)</p>
<p>Palantir has proven its ability to surmount these challenges (and very challenging security considerations, too) by empowering analysts in the allied intelligence community. Our software is available commercially, off the shelf, and it can be deployed very quickly.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the speed with which Palantir can be deployed for operational use and ingest new data sources we analyzed existing federal contract data obtained from <a href="http://usaspending.gov">usaspending.gov</a> and risk-relevant public records data provided by <a href="http://www.rdc.com">Regulatory Data Corp</a>.  RDC provided us with risk-coded, entity extracted data - this makes it possible to rapidly identify the risk-characteristics of individuals and corporations.  We created a video of our analysis.  During our analysis we identified contractors that had billed for duplicate transactions as well as awards to contractors that committed fraud/violated FCPA prior to winning contracts.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="http://www.palantirtech.com/videos/stimulus">this video Demonstration of our idea in practice</a>!</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Only a human can identify fraud, waste and abuse.  Automated checks and machine heuristics are useful, but fraudsters learn rapidly how to get around such systems.  The expert inspectors on the RAT board must have the best technology at their fingertips so that they can be as effective as possible.</p>
<p>An audit trail and knowledge management is crucial so that RAT board itself can be accountable to the public.  To this end, Palantir tracks the steps and actions of every analyst using it.</p>
<p>Palantir is focused on applying technology to enable transparency in the context of <a href="http://www.palantirtech.com/government/regulation">regulation and oversight</a> and we are excited to be participating in the town hall.</p>

<h1>
				Using balanced scorecards for performance-based analytics
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>One of the key imperatives of the Recovery Act is for Federal agencies to take concrete, proactive steps to ensure recipients of stimulus funds are spending the money responsibly, and in a manner that benefits taxpayers.&nbsp; With $787 billion in taxpayers' dollars flowing into the economy in a short period of time, the potential for fraud, waste, and abuse is elevated.&nbsp; It is important for the government to leverage analytic techniques that will allow officials to exercise reasonable oversight without getting bogged down in vast quantities of spending data.</p>
<p>The "Balanced Scorecard" is an example of one of these analytic techniques.&nbsp; A balanced scorecard is a performance management tool used for aligning strategic objectives to operational metrics.&nbsp; A balanced scorecard allows senior executives to rapidly identify areas of risk during execution of their strategic plan by identifying specific operational areas that are performing outside of established norms and parameters.</p>
<p>In the context of Recovery.gov, balanced scorecards can be used to provide a snapshot of prime recipient performance against desired program / economic outcomes. Each prime recipient can be scored in "green - yellow - red" fashion against a set of key performance indicators (KPI). KPIs are measures used to help an enterprise define and evaluate how successful it is.</p>
<p>In the Recovery.gov scenario, KPIs could be established for and mapped to Recovery Act Accountability Objectives established by law and policy.&nbsp; For example, one of the Recovery Act Accountability Objectives defined in OMB Memorandum 09-15 is entitled "Program Outcomes and Economic Outcomes Achieved." Since a key economic outcome of the ARRA is job creation, a KPI could be established to measure cost per job creation.&nbsp; Any grant program or recipient with an excessive cost per job creation could be identified through a balanced scorecard, and could then receive the appropriate level of management and oversight.</p>
<p>Within Recovery.gov, balanced scorecards could be created to evaluate agency, program, and prime recipient performance.&nbsp; One could also create a balanced scorecard to look at stimulus performance on a per-state basis, to ensure fair distribution and use of stimulus funds on a geographic basis. Of course, once scorecard KPIs are established, data collection protocols might need to be tweaked to ensure sufficient data are being collected to support the analytics implemented by the scorecard.</p>
<p>There are numerous technologies, both commercial and open source, that can be used to implement the balanced scorecard features described in this article.&nbsp; For example, Unisys has developed a Recovery Act reporting solution that implements four different types of "accountability scorecards:" Recipient scorecard, program scorecard, state scorecard, and agency scorecard. The Unisys Recovery Act reporting solution was developed using various open source technologies, and is designed to integrate well with Government web hosting environments.</p>

<h1>
				Get the Public's Data onto TheDataWeb 
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau has already created an online network of over a thousand&nbsp;public databases.&nbsp; Using open source software,&nbsp;TheDataWeb is essentially the Internet for public databases. &nbsp;DataFerrett&nbsp;browses TheDataWeb and gives data users the ability to&nbsp;create custom tables based on millions of records on the fly without requiring memory-consuming&nbsp;periodic downloads into large, relational database software.&nbsp; DataFerrett has metadata that works with almost all database software&nbsp;and even&nbsp;incorporates statistical intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report-writing software known as HotReports can display data in web pages with&nbsp;interactive maps, graphs and tables that anyone can use or understand, making data much more accessible.</p>
<p>Many federal, state and private organizations such as Harvard/MIT have made their data available through DataFerrett.&nbsp;&nbsp; This program needs a high-level&nbsp;advocate to secure funding and obtain permissions from the holders of public data&nbsp;beginning with federal agencies, allowing DataFerrett to access&nbsp;the public's data live at the source.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a class="external-link" href="http://dataferrett.census.gov/">http://dataferrett.census.gov/</a></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The more information in the hands of the public as well as decision-makers, the better we can assess the&nbsp;need for&nbsp;and impact of government spending, including stimulus monies.&nbsp; Demographic, economic, health and education statistics&nbsp;could all be found in one place instead of in many separate locations&nbsp;that require users to learn different formats and software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justification for government grants could include objective measures to a&nbsp;greater degree than is now possible.&nbsp; Expansion of&nbsp;TheDataWeb would ensure decisions for funding of public projects are based on the most current, comprehensive and statistically sound data available.&nbsp;It would&nbsp;make it harder for&nbsp;partisan administrations in the future to suppress any data it did not find politically palatable.&nbsp;Government would be more transparent and the public more informed,&nbsp;the hallmarks of democracy.&nbsp;</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I would like to be able to look at the broad category of stimulus funds, for example education, and look at the distribution of funds by state, by town, to be able to see exactly how much money my town received and how the money was spent.&nbsp; For example, were new textbooks, new hardware, or new software purchased?&nbsp; Which school(s) benefited?&nbsp; How many teacher's jobs were saved or created?</p>
<p>(I think it is critical to be able to as accurate a number as possible to know how many jobs were saved or created for each line item.)</p>
<p>Each line item, from the state to the town level, should have a unique identification number, a contact number for the project at that level and a different contact number to report discrepancies or fraud.</p>
<p>If a particular category of funds was declined by the governor of the state, this should be clearly documented as well.</p>
<p>If any projects have a timeline, such as infrastructure projects, it would be nice to see the approximate start and end dates.</p>

<h1>
				Create a Master Data Management schema for use by govt. agencies
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>IBM has a solution called Master Data Management that would provide significant savings, improved performance, and better accuracy of data that agencies and departments in the Federal government need to service citizens as well as employees. <br />Master Data describes physical entities in the real world - such as people, organizations, products, assets and accounts. It is kept by organizations and used to control much of their operation.</p>
<p>Master data is the information an organization stores about the key elements (or business entities) that define its operation.&nbsp; Examples are:</p>
<h1></h1>
<ul><li>Information about people and organizations such as employees, suppliers, partners and departments</li><li>Information about "things" such as products, assets, services, materials, stock </li><li>information about contracts and agreements such as bank accounts, insurance policies, credit agreements, which explain who is using (or is entitled) to use what. </li></ul>
<p>Associated with these Master Data entities are relationships between business entities, hierarchical structures to show how they are organized and classified along with histories of interaction such as audit trails.</p>
<p>Master data is high value information that an organization uses repeatedly across many business processes and lines of businesses (LOBs). For these to operate efficiently, this master data must be accurate and consistent to ensure good decisions. Unfortunately in many organizations, master data is fragmented across many applications, with many inconsistent copies and no plan to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Customers attempting to adopt a Services oriented Architecture (SOA)&nbsp;are having problems supporting simple services such as <em>getCustomerDetails()</em> because their customer data is so scattered and inconsistent that it is not possible to locate and reconcile all of the copies of a customer record on the fly. The master data needs to be corrected at source. <em><strong>Distributing bad data to more people only makes matters worse</strong></em>.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>With the implementation of MDM, there would be significant savings in the number of databases being used and the processes of having to sync them up&nbsp;continuously.&nbsp; The accuracy of the data in these disparate databases would be much improved, and more real time decisions could be made with valid data.</p>

<p>Each state will have some control over how the stimulus money will be applied locally.&nbsp; It will assist the public to know that their interests are kept in mind if there are local ‘stimulus czars’ to lend a voice to certain areas.&nbsp; These czars will be selected off country groups and council boards.&nbsp; Each state depending on size and money distributed will be allotted various czars throughout their counties.&nbsp; They will have monitoring capability of money spent in their areas and offer ‘town halls’ to discuss progress being made with the money in their areas.&nbsp; Additionally, each county website will have a stimulus countdown and weekly update on how money was distributed and utilized.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Most people feel their concerns are not always looked at it when it comes to a change from what they consider the norm.

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Recovery.gov should create and promote the equivalent of an “iPhone app store” which would allow recovery data to be easily accessed, analyzed and/or combined &nbsp;with other data so that it could be visualized in a variety of meaningful ways.<br /><br />Recovery.gov seeks to make all recovery data available to as many people as possible in an open and transparent fashion, and in ways that make it easy for them to use the data in whatever way they see fit, to reach their own conclusions about how the U.S. government is spending stimulus money.<br /><br />There are far more people in the general population who can benefit from tools to explore and understand recovery data than there are people within government who are responsible for publishing the data. This would also invite/allow any developer who has the skills to create novel and useful visualizations of data to do so, bringing many more resources to bear than recovery.gov could on its own.<br /><br />The question is: “how should recovery.gov support them?”<br /><br />An “app store” along the lines used by Apple to support application developers and consumers would promote a consumer-friendly environment where one could host and download small, targeted, flexible applications that can be created and submitted by anyone.<br /><br />Features of the “app store” might include:<br /><br />•<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Simple methods for developers to publish apps.<br />•<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Pre-publication review and curation of apps — sort of an Underwriters Laboratory seal of good practice.</span></p>

<p>Use of GIS to track where recovery&nbsp;funds are being spent, and analize where the funding is truly needed.&nbsp; At its core, GIS&nbsp;is inherently used to make decisions in regards to Geography and the information behind those locations.</p>
<p>Governments of all sizes (City, County, State, and Federal) currently use GIS for many of their daily operations.&nbsp; This infomration needs to be captured at the local level, and moved "upstream" to County levels, and then State, then Federal, to have the most current, accurate information to be used for the analysis behind where the funds need to be spent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Maps, and mapping systems are well known interfaces to the public.&nbsp; Google Earth, Google Maps, Microsoft Virtual Earth, Mapquest, etc...&nbsp; are all applications that the public has become accustomed to using.&nbsp; By using a true Geographic Information System with appropriate analysis capabilities, and feeding this information into such vehicles for public consumption would be a win-win.</p>

<p>Recovery.gov should be a poster

child of the modern IT solution.&nbsp; This would include 100% virtualized

computing resources that are out sourced to an industry leader in providing

commercial companies “cloud” services.&nbsp; This will allow a cost competitive

solution based solely on the solution and not on the acquisition, initial,

support, and other elements inherent in a asset ownership model – this amounts

to up to a 50% reduction in operating costs including the initial

startup.&nbsp; The cloud has the added benefit in increasing the platform

availability, and allow flexible and right sizing of the solution without

the Government buying or decommission hardware assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Cloud solution has the added

benefit in being GREEN – as there is an estimated 60% reduction in hardware

costs and power usage.&nbsp; The net effect of this is a reduction in the

carbon footprint and power consumed in a datacenter.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>pre-formatting so that the respondent simply needs to fill in the numbers, and all calculations are performed based on&nbsp; business rules running invisibly (the process would start with steps similar to the income tax preparation one, where responses to questions such as size of the community, minority populations, unemployment rate, etc. would trigger a variety of questions to determine what regulations might apply in this particular situation). <br /></li><li>a rigorous interactive process that would assume <em>no</em> knowledge of the reporting process on the respondent's part, and would lead him or her through it and make certain that the data is accurate</li><li>behind-the-scenes, the data would be augmented, or “tagged” with

meta-data (“information about information’), using a structured data

format such as <a href="http://techpresident.com/user-blog/www.xbrl.org/WhatIsXBRL/">XBRL, the eXtensible Business Reporting Language</a>

. Once a specific piece of data has been entered into the reporting

system and is tagged, it becomes what you might call a “data nugget,”

with context and meaning garnered from the metadata. The data lives not

as a form, but as information accessible by any computer program that

can “call” or retrieve the data. <br /><br />There is ample precedent for such an approach: on the Federal level, the FDIC already uses XBRL "tags" to capture quarterly information from the nation’s

over 8,000 financial institutions. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A data-centric approach from start to finish in Recovery.gov is

critically important. Collecting accurate data, as opposed to

paper-based reports, provides increased accuracy and flexibility in

both the collection of data and the reporting of the data. . If

structured data is used, it could be accessed both instantly and

simultaneously by a number of government agencies and externally by the

public to assure accountability and transparency.</p>
<ul><li>Like TurboTax, which

gives you options including watching a brief video, reading the exact

wording of the tax code, using its wizard process that guides you

through the process, and (a recent addition) also lets you pose a

question to online users (via a wiki) who might be able to clarify the

answer for you, variations on all of those options can and should be available to

those filling out Recovery.gov forms online. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what steps are taken on the federal level to analyze the data, if it is not accurate when originally entered, everything else will be flawed. However, many of those, especially in small communities with few resources, will have little idea about how to report, increasing the chance of errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By making the reporting process a web-based one, it will be possible to concentrate resources on making certain the data is accurate, rather a decentralized one requiring completing forms, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Equally important, "tagging " the data with XBRL&nbsp; tags so that it can be accessed instantly and simultaneously by a wide variety of federal agencies, watchdog groups and the public will both increase transparency and make the data more valuable.&nbsp; Rather than a one-off process just for the stimulus package, done right this "data-centric" approach could be the first step toward a unified reporting process (based on the innovative "<a class="external-link" href="http://tinyurl.com/cbmnj7">Dutch Taxonomy Project</a>
<p>" )&nbsp; for the future in which municipalities and states would no longer have to file&nbsp; individual reports with multiple agencies but, instead could file a single data file that all agencies could access. This would save massive amounts of money throughout the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TurboTax and its competitors have radically streamlined the 1040 preparation process for

many Americans. A parallel, cloud-based reporting system capitalizing

on the many years of experience with the online tax preparation process

could help Recovery.gov simplify the stimulus reporting process,

capture structured data “nuggets” that could also be used in a variety

of other reports, and significantly improve the accuracy of the

stimulus reporting process.</p>

<p>The actual Bank regulations about home loan should be change to give more opportunity to the people that want buy a house for first time, otherwise the real estate market will be in trouble for long time,&nbsp;The Goverment should&nbsp;requests a detailed inform from the bank about&nbsp;how they&nbsp; expend the 700 billion dollars and push them to create a credit policy that help the american people to start buying their homes.

				Green IT Through Virtualization, Cloud Computing, and a Virtual Desktop inf
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><strong>Use stimulus money to grant new Virtualization, Virtual Desktop Infrastructures, Cloud Computer infrastructures projects<br /><br />Then also use stimulus money to subsidize the infrastructure projects such as:<br /></strong></p>
<ul><li>Virtualize household computers, build home computing infrastructure using common tools.&nbsp; <br /></li>
<ul><li>Purchase of residential bandwidth for telecommunications companies.</li><li>Offset infrastructure costs of extending existing telecommunications services to rural area's<br /></li><li>Acquisition of "Thin compute devices" for home users. <em>which consume less then one tenth of the power standard desktop computers consume.</em><br /></li></ul>
<li>Virtualize power consuming data centers.</li>
<ul><li>Energy credits for utilizing virtualization technology</li><li>Incentives for data center environmental impact reductions.<br /></li></ul>
</ul>
<div><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This idea can be incorporated by households all over the nation.&nbsp; All

classes of citizens could use this technology to reduce household

energy expenses, while ever expanding our information technology

infrastructures.&nbsp; Technology will always be with us, and instead of

having a nation that could be further divided by the "Technology haves"

and the "Technology have <span class="misspell">NOTs</span>"

we should be working to create one technology savvy nation.&nbsp; In 1928

Herbert Hoover had a campaign slogan of "A chicken in every pot and a

car in every garage".&nbsp; We need to modify that slogan for the 21 century

to be "A computer in every house, and energy left to spare"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;It could be further embraced by all companies small, medium or large

that utilize any form of Information technology services, such as the

standard desktop computer, or web, processing, and data layer

technologies.&nbsp; These are all very common in today's Major power

consuming data centers.&nbsp; <br /><br /></div>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Equality is important.<br />Our Nation is important.<br />The Earth is important.<br /><br />Each

one of these concepts alone are import, but together they are vital.&nbsp;

Everyday I see an increasing gap between the individuals who have, and

the individuals who do not.&nbsp; As time goes on the people involved in

this difference are going to grow up, and that gap will translate to an

even greater technology gap, which will in turn will then magnify to a

economic gap.&nbsp; Utilizing Virtualization technologies is a great way to

reduce carbon emissions caused by using older methods of working on the

Internet.&nbsp; <br /><br /></p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>There are different constituencies that will want to have access to this information--John Q.

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>There are multiple systems currently in use that gather lots of data.&nbsp; Rather than creating new systems, lets improve the systems we have to ensure they are "user friendly", intuitive, have edit checks to minimize erroneous or conflicting data, ensure that mandatory fields are mandatory; minimize data collection that is not needed and provides clear instruction, on-line, to the user.&nbsp; Another system is not needed; better current systems are needed.&nbsp; When improving the current systems, the reporting and searching capability needs to be improved as well.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Existing systems capture significant amounts of data; however, they are not intuitive nor are they "user friendly".&nbsp; This applies to their search and reporting capability as well, which is of particular interest to the public.&nbsp; Before investing in new systems, determine if existing systems can be improved.&nbsp; If not, get rid of the existing system and substitute a new, intuitive, user friendly system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the law reads right now the child tax credit and additional child tax credit and additional child tqax credit&nbsp;can be used by people who do not have a social security number.&nbsp; In fact they are not citizens of the US.&nbsp; The law needs to be changed that says only people and children under 17 that have a valid Social Security Number are eligible for this credit.&nbsp; This credit should be for <u>US citizens and permanent legal residents&nbsp;only.</u></p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Instead of going out and spending more money on a solution or capability, the government should look at what it has already invested in and use it to do collection of&nbsp;data, storage, deliver analytics with a geospatial component (so people can search from a map of their area) and communicate it out to the public.</p>
<p>To give you an example, 90% of the US Federal government already own some super powerful technologies from Microsoft (including SharePoint and PerformancePoint and SQL) that are built with connectors specifically designed to connect too and draw data from almost any systems (Microsoft and non), provide tha ability to aggregate the data, display it on a map and filter that view,&nbsp;analyze the information by simple tables or full blown OLAP cubing, make it searchable and give users the ability to do further self-driven analysis using tools they all already know how to use, namely Excel with charts and tables! Even better this is all delivered through just a browser...so no version challenges or even the need for Excel on the local machine.</p>
<p>In addition it is already built with an inherent&nbsp;security model that provides the collection and dissemination of the data without exposing the underlying financial systems and doesn't necessarily need a data staging area (but can accommodate one if necessary).</p>
<p>I just want the government to examine the really powerful capabilities they all already have, and give the data to us Citizens in a format we are used to working with, and is secure!</p>

<p>It would be nice to use a database like FRED as the St. Louis Federal Reserve to collect relevant metrics with which to model the effectiveness of the stimulus package.&nbsp; Many of us already use this database for various econometric models and find it to be reasonably well maintained.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is often lacking the regional, temporal or industry specific granularity that we would like to have, but it is a good starting point and provides tools one can use to import the relevant time series into sophisticated statistical packages for time series analysis, intervention analysis, causality testing, etc.&nbsp; Every effort should be made to collect data at the highest possible frequency.&nbsp; Weekly would be ideal, but monthly observations would be adequate and make seasonal adjustment easier.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>We should leverage existing technology and make the data available to the widest possible audience.</p>

<p>All Federal IT projects should adopt a formal mechanism for managing the complexity of new IT projects.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>66% of all Federal IT dollars are invested in high risk projects, that is, projects that are likely to fail. This number has been steadily increasing. It was 30% in 2007, 43% in 2008. At the current rate of increase, by the year 2010 this number will be close to 100%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only is IT failure a huge cost to the Federal budget ($47 billion, in 2009), but there is an even larger cost to the US economy as a whole. For every dollar in direct cost, there is at least another five dollars in indirect costs. The actual costs to the US economy are therefore in the neighborhood of $300 billion dollars per year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason that so many Federal IT projects are at high risk is that there is no effective IT complexity management strategy. The complexity of the systems being build is increasing and the tools for project management have not kept pace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complexity is exponentially related to functionality. That means that as the functionality of an IT system increases, its complexity increases much faster. And both system cost and system risk go up with complexity, so small additions of functionality can increase the risk of failure dramatically especially as the system approaches the breaking point, as most Federal IT systems have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer to this is a Federally mandated program to train IT managers in understanding how complexity impacts IT systems and developing effective processes for managing and mitigating IT complexity. Not only would such a program greatly reduce the failure risk of Federal IT systems, it would also reduce their cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, the answer to IT complexity is found in partitioning IT systems based on synergies between functionality. Applying this concept to a large IT system can reduce the overall complexity, cost, and risk of system failure by at least 75%. If this approach is applied across the entire spectrum of Federal IT, we can expect to reduce the cost of Federal IT from today’s $71 billion per year to around $35 billion per year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only will we reduce the cost, but we will see a dramatic improvement in the number of systems that are actually delivered. We will also see an marked improvement in the quality of those systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This program is a win-win strategy. We save money at the same time as we improve government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>There's about $50M in the budget for recovery.gov.&nbsp; One architecture that's been suggested would end up costing well over $300M.&nbsp; Another option is very cheap, although heavily manual.&nbsp; I have seen ideas ranging from a vague notion of using open source (presumably assembled and maintained by a systems integrator) to leading edge BI tools.&nbsp; Given the options for spending versus value, there appear to be substantial tradeoffs.&nbsp; In addition, there appear to options for acquiring the solution (i like the service-based options versus the custom build).&nbsp; But, i am not sure that there is a program manager engaged who has run a $50M program before.&nbsp; Recovery.gov is an investment in good government, performance&nbsp;and accountability.&nbsp; Every good information technology solution which offers transformation as big as recovery.gov ought to have a business case that:</p>
<p>--&nbsp;articulates measures of success (is it communication of results or achievement of accountability, and how do you measure it?).</p>
<p>-- evaluates options to acquire the features and functions, as well as business processes needed to achieve success,</p>
<p>-- and tracks or captures benefits recieved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>I worry that there are so many ideas, the likely solution will be high risk and the whole transparency initaitive will die under its own weight.</p>

				Limits of creativity of spending
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>We need to limit spending to true infrastructure rebuilding.&nbsp; Those concepts are the basis of governmental spending both in good and bad economic times.&nbsp; Spending should absolutely exclude the construction or rebuilding of recreational areas and entertainment areas as they are not essential to an economic crippled society and this is truly the job of private investment.&nbsp; Infrastructure rebuilding should also exclude those areas that are proven to have recurring issues with nature such as much of Louisiana and Mississippi near the coastal areas prone to future extreme damage due to the adversities of weather.&nbsp; When we put positive infrastructure dollars to work in renewable areas of society's physical infrastructure rather than being humbled by congressional special interest "pork barrel" our country can truly advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>As we are spending the money of the tax payers of future generations, it must be guarded as a trust.&nbsp; Since it is the tax&nbsp; dollars of future generations, it should not be spent exclusively for the benefit of current citizens who have exhibited somewhat of a disregard of maintaining the infracture that is crumbling around our feet.</p>

				Use of Key Performance Indicators as Oversight Tool
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Development of Standardized Key Performance Indicator (KPI) reporting bottoms up:&nbsp; at the recipient/applicant level, at the state level, at the Federal Agency level and, ultimately, for all of ARRA (aggregation of all levels).</p>
<p>KPIs can be developed for all relevant programs and&nbsp;act as early warning system/risk assessment method for capuring status of projects and distribution of funds.</p>
<p>A KPI framework for ARRA:</p>
<p>Using DOT funds (this can be done for all programs) KPI reporting can be developed as follows:</p>
<p>Applicant Level - KPI to measure procurement type (e.g. fixed price, unit price, GMP), contract size, original budget, current budget, cost at completion and amounts expended, funding sources, change orders, schedule - NTP, 50% complete and 75% complete, substantial and final completion, requests for information (RFI), % funds reviewed for financial compliance versus amounts submitted for payment, davis bacon compliance</p>
<p>State Level - aggregation by applicant, contract type, project&nbsp;type (for testing price), project size, NTP, 50% estimated completion data and final (projected and actual), budget/cost information aggregated by applicant, funding information aggregated by applicant/project typ</p>
<p>Federal Level - similar roll up by state/applicant if necessary.</p>
<p>ARRA - aggregation of federal agency/state</p>
<p>Threshold of acceptability for data points can be used to generate dashboard reporting and act as proactive early warning system of potential non compliance with ARRA requirements/fraud or other desired measurable parameter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This is important as this structure can be scaled quickly once parameters are known.&nbsp; This approach is IT netral:&nbsp; one of many solutions can be used to set up this methodology using thin IT applications.&nbsp; This approach can implemented quickly accross multiple organizations operating differently, procuring differently.&nbsp; This approach extracts mission critical information under a wide range of organizations.&nbsp; THis approach can be developed to be used in reviewing submitted payments using ARRA funds prior to payment and has been used successfully on programs of similar scale.&nbsp; This idea is a key tool in developing risk provides for all levels of ARRA.&nbsp; Tihs idea extracts data needed to test for fraud/abuse.</p>

				Oregon Stimulus Transparency &amp; Accountability Tracking System
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">A high degree of transparency and accountability is expected in the way the American Recovery &amp; Reinvestment Act funds are spent.&nbsp; The Oregon Stimulus Transparency &amp; Accountability Tracking System (ORSTATS) is one of the key tools to provide that transparency and accountability.&nbsp; ORSTATS includes three primary components:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>a database</u> to capture information about stimulus expenditures</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>a reporting tool</u> to monitor individual projects and programs</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>a mapping tool</u> to visualize the data and track the impact of stimulus funds</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Transparency is our ability to see where stimulus funded activities are taking place in Oregon.&nbsp; Accountability is seeing that stimulus dollars are spent responsibly and JOBS ARE CREATED or PRESERVED in the locations where the dollars are spent.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Governor Kulongoski’s Economic Recovery Executive Team (ERET) has declared that ORSTATS is the single system for planning, tracking and reporting on all stimulus expenditures for which the Governor’s Office and state agencies have reporting responsibilities, regardless of which agency or organization receives recovery funds.&nbsp; The ERET has also made this system available to local governments and other ARRA fund recipients for their use in planning, tracking and reporting stimulus expenditures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The web-based maps and information will allow state agencies and local governments to plan, track, and report on stimulus spending to achieve the greatest possible impact.&nbsp; The web-based maps will allow Oregonians to see how and where economic stimulus funds are spent and the economic impact of those expenditures on their communities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ORSTATS will provide agencies the ability to plan where stimulus dollars are spent based on the greatest likely impact. In some cases, that will be the potential for creating jobs, but it could also be the potential for lowering crime rates, hunger, homelessness, or student-teacher ratios, or perhaps raising student proficiency levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the dollars have been spent, ORSTATS will provide agencies the ability to track and report on many measures of impact.&nbsp; Visualizing potential and actual impact on a map provides a quick and easily understandable picture of stimulus effectiveness for government agencies and the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Knowing where stimulus dollars are spent is the only way to track the impact of those dollars in relationship to the problems they are intended to resolve, like unemployment, crime, hunger, homelessness, improved education, sustainabile energy development, etc.</p>

				Make collecting recovery data agile using semantic web technology
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">
<div>The goal of recovery.org is to create transparency around how stimulus dollars are being allocated and spent. The challenge to tracking, correlating, and analyzing relevant information is that this data is extremely heterogeneous. Some is captured in the spreadsheets that agencies post to recovery.gov. But, other important sources of data originate from many distinct agencies and cover a wide range of projects with differing metrics, definitions of terms, andcharacteristics. &nbsp;Data residing in a myriad of systems and formats make it hard for the average citizen to access it and interpret it. &nbsp;In short, complexity inhibits transparency.<br /><br />Recovery.gov should adopt semantic web technologies as key enablers for promoting an agile, transparent data ecosystem in which federal agencies and other recipients of stimulus monies can share spending and performance data in a way that is truly transparent, readily available, and useful to anyone who wants to view, consume, or analyze the information.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Semantic technologies were created to solve the problem of how to link and query heterogeneous data from files, databases, documents, and web pages. &nbsp;The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) publishes a set of open technology standards, known as Semantic Web technologies, for integrating disparate data in a way that is well-defined, traceable, easy to consume, and supported by a variety of tools.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Semantic Web technologies ease data collection by acting as a virtual integration layer. That is, agencies can and should continue to collect data in traditional databases, XML files, or Excel spreadsheets. Semantic Web technologies weave this information into a unified fabric so that it can be examined, analyzed, and understood by other citizens, legislators, oversight bodies, etc.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Application of semantic web technologies contributes to a “Web of Linked Data” that allows anyone with a Web browser to ‘surf’ a trail of data back to its source and better understand the information being published under ARRA's requirements.</div>
</span></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">
<div>ARRA requirements represent a fundamental step forward for transparency, openness, and accountability on the part of government agencies and those benefiting from stimulus funds. But, accessing spreadsheets that&nbsp;agencies use to&nbsp;summarize activity to recovery.gov is only part of the story. To detect waste, fraud, and abuse we need more encompassing data forensics. &nbsp;That is, information wants to be linked and correlated&nbsp;with heterogeneous information and data from many other sources. Making it easy to expose the semantics and structure of varied sources in a standard way is critical to investigative success.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the data is stored and presented in a way that is difficult to access or confusing, the interpretation will be that the government’s intention is to be something less than transparent. &nbsp;Making the data available in a way that is easy to consume and use will foster and image of true transparency on the part of the government.</div>

<p>The Obama pledge for transparency along with the recent OMB Recovery Act Guidance has created something of a burning fuse for the administration, presenting a great risk both to the credibility of The White House, and the success of the Recovery Act investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;While current studies show general support across the nation for the stimulus effort, there lingers a degree of skepticism amongst the Congress, the citizenry and the media in the ability of the government to administer the investments fairly, effectively, and without widespread corruption and fraud.</p>

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><span class="large"><em>“Those of us who manage the public’s dollars will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.”</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More fundamentally, however, the Recovery Act is intended to go far beyond serving as a mechanism for stimulating the economy. It inherently calls for a transformation in the relationship between the government and its citizenry, long after the last stimulus dollar has been spent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here’s the burning fuse:&nbsp; While the current body of thought has focused primarily on the methods for collecting reports, the real crux of the matter lies in how the OMB and Recovery.gov,&nbsp;in concert with funding agencies from across the ecosystem, can ensure that the information presented in the reports is accurate, complete, and consistent; and in the degree to which the public is able to drill into the information across agencies and to a level of detail sufficient to convince them that the information can be trusted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The credibility of Recovery.gov, and indeed the credibility of the administration, &nbsp;lies chiefly in the trust and confidence across the government, citizenry and media that there exists straightforward access to relevant spending and impact information, and that this information is both accurate and complete – even though the sources of this information lie across a complex ecosystem of heterogeneous federal, state and local agencies, as well as private interests -- each with existing investments in program management, business processes and underlying infrastructure and data models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine this:&nbsp; On October 10 citizens log on to Recovery.gov, and being to poke around.&nbsp; They see that Recovery.gov is reporting the results of an investment program that has been put in place across several states -- X number of jobs produced, with Y $$'s of investment.&nbsp; These numbers are the aggregates from several states.&nbsp; Yet, when the individual drills into those states, or goes directly to the individual state websites, the numbers don't add up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Result:&nbsp; Loss of credibility in the results of the Recovery Act investments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Ultimately, the PERCEIVED success of the Recovery Act is not so much about managing funds as it is about the enormous challenge of managing <u>information</u> – ensuring the information is reliable and readily accessible in real time.</em></strong></p>
<p>Our clients tell us that while they need to move in the short term to standup a capability to meet the reporting mandates, longer term they need to develop a new level of agility to respond to the evolving demands of the new stimulus management environment. At the highest level, they need the tools to streamline and more efficiently manage the proposal and grant processes, and engage in strategic decision making. They need both broad and detailed views of stimulus-related information and processes, made possible through robust dashboards and scorecards.&nbsp;&nbsp; They need solid transactional and operational reports, for both internal and citizen centric reporting.&nbsp;&nbsp; To track how they are spending their funds and the progress of the agencies they support, they need sophisticated project and performance management capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Above all, they need tools to ensure that they can trust the information they are using to optimize their investment, and to share across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second set of guidance from OMB points to the development of a central facility for collecting reports from funding agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; In developing this facility and providing further guidance to the funding agencies OMB should strive 1) to create a standardized data model that 2) allows the bi-directional flow of information; and 2) to ensure data quality, accuracy and completeness; and 3) consistent reporting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a more detailed level, based on our ongoing conversations with Federal and State &amp; Local funding agencies the OMB should keep the following architectural guidelines in mind – both as it provides further guidance and in developing its own capabilities:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Trusted Information is the key to the success of Recovery.gov.&nbsp; If the information is easily accessible, AND is accurate, complete and consistent, faith in the Recovery Act is maintained.&nbsp; If it is innacurate, or hard to access -- credibility is lost, and the publis loses faith in the Recovery Act Itself.</p>

				Using recovery.gov data for analysis and prediction of mpact
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The large volume of data that will be collected on Recovery.com offers an opportunity to apply advanced data analytics to understand the impact, both intended and unintended, of ARRA investments.&nbsp; A key question is the speed with which ARRA investments will start to demonstrate quantifiable return on investment (ROI) in terms of job creation and other tangible measures of economic recovery.&nbsp; The above mission statement mentions for instance the objective of estimating of how many jobs are being created.&nbsp; There could be a role here for fairly sophisticated analytical models that, for example, isolate the impact of ARRA investments on job creation and other primary and secondary measures of economic health at the level of either the state or Congressional District.&nbsp; Understanding and analyzing the link between investments and concrete outcomes (new jobs, improved health) and their explicit (job creation) or implicit (use of public transportation, gas consumption) measurements requires a combination of expertise that includes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Macro economists </li><li>Labor-based economist</li><li>Econometrics </li><li>Data management skills</li><li>Experts in demographic and other public data sources</li><li>Statistical modeling</li><li>Machine learning for validation of causal relationships</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analytical models would require temporal (e.g. monthly) data on ARRA investment by category (see different groupings on the Recovery.com site) and measurements of direct and indirect indicators of economic health. In addition, detailed demographic data is needed at the same level to allow controls for non-ARRA related effects.&nbsp; Such models could provide evidence for the relative success of recovery investments and can also provide insight on optimal allocation of certain types of investments against types of districts in terms of their demographic composition. &nbsp;Graphical and causal modeling will further establish a more sophisticated view of the cause-and-effect relationship between ARRA investments and indicators of recovery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery.gov encourages anyone to visit the site and share their stories on how the recovery act is impacting them as individuals.&nbsp; This information provides a wealth of insight into how and where ARRA is succeeding and failing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Advanced data analytics models could be developed to mine all such posts and determine the topic discussed in each posting, as well as the sentiment expressed relative to this topic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further processing of these results could present intriguing trends at the grass-roots level that will allow officials to assess the impact by geographical sector (i.e. Congressional District), by government agency overseeing aspects of the recovery plan, and by the specifics of each spending initiative.&nbsp; This insight, coupled with the more traditional economic modeling discussed above, could paint a very unique picture of the evolving recovery from both a top-down and bottoms-up perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the expertise identified above, this analysis of individual feedback would require the following skills:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Unstructured information management</li><li>Natural language processing for feature extraction from unstructured content</li><li>Machine learning in high-dimensional spaces</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Timely analysis of data from recovery.gov, particularly when combined with other data reported by states and regions, will provide both ordinary citizens and our elected and appointed leaders with deeper understanding of the impact of spending on local and national objectives. It will enable us to more quicklet determine what "works"&nbsp;which can lead to more effective use of our nation's resources.</p>

				Job-o-meters
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Feds develop a <strong>national jobs reporting rubric</strong> (saved and created) and all ARRA projects must be required to comply right up front: all proposals need a jobs column in order to even be considered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As projects get rolling,&nbsp;states feature&nbsp;job-o-meters&nbsp;to disclose and count jobs on their web-based 'recovery' sites -- the&nbsp;Federal site should do the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A huge illuminated&nbsp;counter needs to be installed in Times Square to chart the national progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p align="left" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, ARRA will only work if it saves and creates jobs. &nbsp;&nbsp; "One area where we believe states would benefit from Federal assistance is with the calculation of jobs, both created and retained, and particularly those characterized as either indirect or induced. There is some data and methods available for estimating such job figures in particular policy areas, however we believe the best way to arrive and report on jobs is to have the states supply raw data, and to have the Federal government model and report jobs data.</p>
<p align="left" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp; Testimony by Timothy Gilchrist (Office of NY Governor David A. Paterson to the&nbsp; House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Hearing on April 21, 2009) states the need succinctly:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp; The effort to report on jobs would benefit greatly from a common set of tools – developed by the Federal government, and made available to states, local governments any other direct ARRA-fund recipient.”</p>

				Deeper Analytics &amp; Visualization
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Deeper analytics and richer visualization specific to the requirements set forth in the latest OMB Guidance of 4/3 and under the requirements of the Recovery Act. Federal agencies must&nbsp;be able to effectively manage the Recovery Act funds that they have been entrusted to manage and to ensure that the results attained by the investment of those funds achieve the goals set forth by the Administration. We believe a COTS solution, specifically developed for the Recovery Act requirements and can be modified for use by both Federal agencies and state and local governments achieves those goals. Please give us your feedback based on a notional demo we have created: <a href="http://www.cognos.com/solutions/industry/government/economic-recovery.html?mc=-web_hp">http://www.cognos.com/solutions/industry/government/economic-recovery.html?mc=-web_hp</a>.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>It is critical to be able to monitor and measure where those funds have been invested, report on the results achieved at a program by program level and with an aggregated view, to be able to drill down deeper into programs and use advance analytic capabilities to fully understand the impact those funds will have on stimulating local economies and creating jobs. We have developed a solution that allows both Federal government agencies disbursing funds and state and local government who are the recipients of funds to track in depth how those funds have been invested and the results they have generated to date.</p>
<p>This solution can be modified QUICKLY to meet the changing requirements and&nbsp;ties in with an overall Government Performance Management Solution.<br /><br /></p>

				Social Networks &amp; Grants Management 
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>President Obama has the vision, we have to match that vision on the implementation/organizational side of the equation, while we save money, leverage limited resources, and demonstrate practical and useful outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without a fundamental shift in how we implement programs, our President will be blamed if things "don't work". The public rarely thinks about the organizational capacity needed to match a truly different paradigm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My idea combines the fundamental principles of good government, efficiency, best practices and accountability with Web 2.0 social media technologies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Utilizing social networking practices, in grant and other applied setting programs, will enhance the ability of agencies to communicate, organize work products, share discoveries, conduct failure analysis and break down geographical boundaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a convergence between how social networks, properly administrated, would work, save money, deal with geographical issues, promote best practices and address many grant administration and program problems and issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many choices in how we set up a social networks.&nbsp; I am suggesting using the Ning framework.&nbsp; It is easy to create closed systems/networks, only for the grantees in each grant program and the grant administrator, not open to the general public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to use social networking platforms as program tools. Right now grant administration is labor intensive, very costly and rarely captures the wins in the communities granted the funds.&nbsp; We "get together" with our grantees by inviting them to come to Washington, DC for a conference, maybe once a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the time the grantees never really know each other or what they are doing with the funding, they rarely get to share a great idea or big problem, they are scattered around the country craving connection and usually not getting it in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grantees may get site visits, but that is only one part of the grant program and always a snapshot.&nbsp; Even training and technical assistance needs could be met in different ways with much less money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applied and practical evaluation methodologies could easily be facilitated through a well designed social network as well.&nbsp; On the ground, community programs would greatly benefit by learning how to conduct meaningful evaluation strategies, without having to become scientists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you imagine, if each grant initiative had their own&nbsp; social network, as part of their grant?&nbsp; Only the grantees would be allowed to be members.&nbsp; The grant administrator would also be the social network administrator. It would make so many things easier, including communication, geography, best practices shared between grantees, evaluation, etc.&nbsp; It would save a lot of money and time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My extensive experience in grants, grant evaluation, training, technical assistance, building collaborative partnerships, discovering best practices and planning for results, in combination with using this social networking framework, convinces me this technology would make a significant difference in the accomplishment of tricky and multiple goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure this will change the landscape of how we manage complex program initiatives. It doesn't solve all the problems, but it will help a lot and meet many criteria not met currently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Administration challenges federal agencies to think outside the box, increase accountability and public transparency, we will see a simultaneous emphasis on collaboration, community building, leveraging resources, reducing redundancy and increasing outcomes with public money.&nbsp; The social networking paradigm I'm suggesting will meet these goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Utilizing social networking practices, in grant and other applied setting programs, will enhance the ability of agencies to communicate, organize work products, share discoveries and break down geographical boundaries (huge issue). Security, delicate issues and finances do not need to be a part of this for this to work!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Background:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recipient of $3M Community Partnership Grant to Study Community Collaboration, Planning for Results and Applied Setting Evaluation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justice Department Fellow at COPS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retrospectively evaluated the innovative Advancing Community Policing Grants in the United States.&nbsp; Matched evaluation style with the values we wanted to create to cut down on cognitive dissonance.&nbsp; Justice and I published a best practices book (about this project) and distributed it to over 7,000 local law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have extensive experience is using social networks to build community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>We will match President Obama's vision with actual practice.&nbsp; We will save time and money and accomplish many things that were previously labor intensive.</p>
<p>We will connect people all over the country, under each grant program, into one community.&nbsp; We will infuse the social networks with the values and goals integral to the project goals.</p>
<p>We will build online communities, increase efficiency, capitalize on grantee learning, discover issues quickly, use the "community to solve problems", save money, time and leverage limited resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's innovative, creative, uses knowledge in practical ways, can be shared and replicated and continuously improved.</p>
<p>In addition it will increase our organizational capacity, grantee capacity and connect people far beyond the grant cycle so we are likely to have more sustainable results.</p>

				Data storage for paperless medical records
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Provide a Smart Medical ID card for anyone who wants one to keep all personal (and family) medical records, but not billing information.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use existing&nbsp;security system&nbsp;that would require both&nbsp;a medical professional and patient to access information on the card with exceptions for emergency situations.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>I recently heard an interview with a medical professional on the huge computer, data, and network complexities for sharing medical records digitally.&nbsp; The doctor was trying to make the point that a single practice with a hundred patients might need to share data on a single patient with many other practices and the possible combinations were huge.</p>
<p>Why not let the patient be the holder of the most up-to-date data and the individual doctors would have a copy of that data.&nbsp; I would go to my normal doctor with my card and they would update there information from my card.&nbsp; My doctor would make notes and update to my card.&nbsp; For a referral, I could okay the transfer to another doctor from my card.&nbsp; I would have my card when I go to the next doctor.&nbsp; Labs would share results with the doctor requesting and these would be applied to my card at my next visit.</p>
<p>Bottom line -- I should keep the main copy of my medical records, not the doctor.</p>

<h1>
				Follow the money ... or Focus on Outcomes?
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Many contibutors will have much better ideas than me on tracking the funds and developing greater transparency in the spending. My concern is the inevitable question: "and what did we get for that?"</p>
<p>And the answer should be in terms we can all understand. Luckily, there's an ISO standard that helps - ISO 9001:2008 IWA 4.&nbsp; This standard describes the expectations of a "reliable local government."</p>
<p>The really&nbsp;applicable item regarding reporting&nbsp;in IWA 4 is the so-called "check-up system" that is incorporated into the standard. The check up includes 39 indicators of performance, divided among 4 areas of social responsibility:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Institutional development of good government</li><li>Sustainable economic development</li><li>Inclusive social development</li><li>Sustainable environmental development</li></ol>
<p>What makes this framework worthy?</p>
<ul><li>First, it focuses on&nbsp;outcomes. </li><li>Second, it uses language that citizens understand (which may include Congressional committees!). </li></ul>
<p>And since it can be applied in a common reference model, the federal government can choose the 2-4 indicators in each quadrant that ALL stimulus recipients must report on (so you can get a national perspective), with the remaining indicators availalble for use by States and local governments to choose from that may be most meaningful to their constituents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Accounting is not transparency. One might think that adding up the numbers tells us something, but I suspect it helps foster hearings, not outcomes.</p>
<p>Most citizens will not know nor care how well anyone did at their FACTS II budget execution reporting. I grudgingly acknowledge it will be neccessary, just as it is probably necessary to know how much water was used to put out a fire. But stopping the fire is the important result. Protecting lives and property is meaningful. The cost of gasoline and water, not so much.</p>
<p>So my analogy may be silly. But it's meant to point us toward a more meaningful context for knowing "what did we get" for the spending. The IWA 4 framework offers that kind of outcome-based consideration of the results.</p>
<p>I am also confident that any good IT service provider can easily build an XBRL&nbsp;reference model for tagging IWA 4 indicators and mapping them to business functional&nbsp;and financial data reporting.</p>
<p>Then you can power-up Recovery.gov to dynamically generate outcome metrics by any level of government that a citizen would like to see, as well as revealing the underlying data. But now it will have context and meaning that even my Dad (79) and son (17) can understand.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>As Government transparency matures a large majority of the information being shared will likely be "digital data", i.e. more then ust documents we will have facts &amp; figures, some automatically generated as well as "expert statements".</p>
<p>I'd like a system by which we could provide a tag to such data to help highlight it's "truthie-ness".</p>
<p>I'd like to know which experts may (dis)approve of a statement or legislation as well as have a sense of trust associated when I'm given a number.</p>
<p>As examples;</p>
<p>1) If someone issues a statement that "Solving &lt;X&gt; will cost $90 million" I'd like to know who agrees, and who disagrees and be able to find (directly from the data) the various opinion.</p>
<p>2) Or if I'm told the USPS saved $10 million in fuel costs by switching to a more optimized delivery system and cutting out Thursday deliveries I'd like to know if any experts have vouched for that number and what the margin for error is.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>As policy and decisions will be increasingly decided based on data driven analysis and visualizations. It's critical that those numbers are not simply pulled from thin air and that we can discern the pedigree of such statments.</p>

				Push versus Pull for oversight of funds
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Enable the oversight agencies and the public to "pull" data and information via a "cloud computing" paradigm.&nbsp; Through web services API standards all agencies would be able to populate the "cloud" with relative ease.&nbsp; The information in the cloud would then be available to anyone based upon their need and requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The traditional method used to gather information for reporting purposes is a "push" method where agencies are required to provide data at certain times, in certain formats to create a centralized data repository.&nbsp; The problem is that these systems are extremely complex and expensive to build and maintain requiring standardization and centralization of systems and processes across an extremely varied set of agencies, missions and services.&nbsp; Therefore, it puts the government in a position to fail even before they begin.&nbsp; Its like asking 15 completely different commercial organizations from different industries to do the same thing - impossible.&nbsp; Utilizing the cloud computing method you are able to place information in a cloud from any source at any time through API interface standards thereby reducing the impact and cost to the government.&nbsp; Then the oversight agencies and public can "pull" data at any time making trasparency possible.&nbsp; The "pulling" method is faster, better and cheaper enabling the government to be in the business of oversight versus the business of data collection and management under the current more traditional, expensive and inefficient "push" method.</p>

<p>The way i envision recovery.gov to be, it needs to include a graphic view where the average person can click on the amount signed in the act ($787B). this should allow the user drill to the next level down (i.e infrastructure, tax cuts etc). the user should be able to drill down further and further to see how the money is distributed to the projects, states and communities in a sort of hierarchical structure. ideally, the lowest level should show (details on individual project, how much was allocated &amp; has been spent, how many jobs were created). all these numbers should roll-up to the top level to keep a counter so that any visitors to recovery.gov can see a rolling counter of jobs created, $$ spent, total number of projects funded/completed.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>it helps to simplify the user view of recovery.gov ..... the current website is very nice, but somewhat "busy" ... not easy to find information. many people dont have an attention span long enough to read everything on the website to see the good stuff buried several layers down. the majority of visitors to the site come in to see where the money is being spent. it makes the data presentation more user friendly.</p>

Why is it important?) -- and then allow for the rating/promotion/demotion of the ideas by recovery.gov visitors. Then, have a team focussed on using the available data to answer the top questions <em>in a clearly understandable way, </em>meaning effectively visualized (separate idea) with direct access to the underlying data used to answer the question.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The government&nbsp;should consider key trusted security advisor and security partner/s in monitoring expenditures and using recovery funds.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The government must consider the likelihood of piracy and theft of both direct capital as well as information capital as it carries out its recovery tasking.&nbsp; All levels of security must be accounted for and employed including Governance and Compliance at a high-level as well as securing People and Identity, Data and Information, Applications and Processes, Networks Servers and Endpoints, and most certainly Physical Infrastructure.&nbsp; While the government does indeed have home-grown capability in each area, it can certainly benefit from corporate knowledge, strategies and products&nbsp;both for best-practices as well as cost-saving security tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critical to leveraging the corporate arena will be finding actual corporations that provide best-of-breed products and services and resources that have both a strong R&amp;D backbone as well as real-world implementation in ideally a global setting.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two must co-exist for effective&nbsp;continual security as the world of cyber-crime and cyber-terrorism methodologies&nbsp;is in constant flux.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So which companies exist that provide such comprehensive security?&nbsp; There really is no actual silver bullet as being able to completely overhaul existing security infrastructure is cost-prohibitive.&nbsp; However, being able to leverage a corporation with deep security knowledge, frameworks to integrate security tools that are cross-vendor rather than&nbsp;straight rip-and-replace, as well as significant incumbency and experience does fortunately exist.&nbsp; IBM immediately comes to mind as a clear-cut leader.&nbsp;</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Loans Available to Small Business
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Loans should be available to small businesses who have been in business for a year or two, and have little working capital. In order to expand and add employees, by submitting a proposed expansion plan, they can get a loan that they currently can't get because banks aren't loaning and the SBA requires collateral or a cosigner, neither of which most of these businesses has. Loans could be between $25,000 and $50,000 or less dependent on need. Interest should be low and repayment of at least ten years.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This idea is important because many small businesses who supply many of the low level blue collar jobs and even some low level white collar jobs, can no longer afford to operate, and will either close and lay off most employees or lay off the employees just to eke out a minimal living. It is the small businesses of the country that make it run efficiently and make products available to a vast majority of it's citizens.</p>

<h1>
				Geospaital enabled live data feeds (GIS Services)
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Geospaital enabled live data feeds (GIS Services), similar to what DC Government has made avaialable at:</p>
<p><a href="http://data.octo.dc.gov/"><strong>http://data.octo.dc.gov/</strong></a></p>
<p>Transparency and Accountability starts with open access to authoratative data in an actionable format. The DC Government has begun to publish relavent data as "live feeds"&nbsp;in many formats including&nbsp;XML, ATOM, GEORSS, KML, etc. These Live data feeds make it possable to develop applications driven by the data to disminiate information. One example is the MPD Crime Map Site: <a href="http://crimemap.dc.gov">http://crimemap.dc.gov</a> , built off of the crime data feeds citizens can see and comapare crime in the areas that effect them. Geospaital is neccessary, everything is about place.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This idea is important because in one week's time tapping only a small audiance all ideas can not be explored. Providing the raw data as feeds for developers will allow for many future solutions, the general masses will selcet what they like best through popularity (a killer app like facebook happens because the masses imbrace it, nothing else).</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Allowing data searches similar to the American Community Survey
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>It would be helpful if www.recovery.gov users could search by area to see how much money that area is receiving along with breakdowns of how that money is specifically being used.&nbsp; This could be done through a search tool similar to the one on the American Community Survey website.&nbsp; This would allow users to see dollar allocations for the nation, by state, by metropolitan statistical area, by county, or by city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is especially important because people need assistance in determining where all&nbsp; of the money is going at the local level.&nbsp; It would also allow community planners to examine what other regions are doing with stimulus dollars and to build off of their ideas for their own cities or counties.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This is about accessibility of information down to the smaller extensions of our government.&nbsp; To ensure transparency at all levels, and to improve community planning efforts, data on how stimulus dollars are being used should be available through a comprehensive search tool.</p>

<h1>
				Common User Interface
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Addmittedly, I am not a technology expert. However, I think it is important that there is a common hub or screen where users interact with the data. Separating it all out by agency with different pages for each is inefficient and not engaging. Internet users need customizable template or interface with which they interact with Recovery data.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Engaging people from one pane, a single page, that is dynamic will make understanding the connections between the work beign done by this element of recovery and another.</p>

<p>Applied Identity’s Identisphere line of identity aware network solutions are

purpose-built platforms that can be deployed within the internal network to

protect critical resources from unauthorized access. The Identisphere product

line contains all of the elements needed to enable the “identity aware”

network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc"><li><strong>ID-Audit</strong> provides IT

     departments with a powerful window into their network that displays both

     real-time and historical user and resource activity. ID-Audit allows

     network and security administrators to visualize a baseline of events that

     can be reported on and used to satisfy internal and external audit

     requirements. For more information <a href="http://www.appliedidentity.com/products/id-audit">click here</a>.</li><li><strong>ID-Unify</strong> allows the

     management of user identities between disparate identity stores. This

     creates a virtual mapping and normalization of user information without duplication

     of identity objects and attributes and without requiring changes to

     existing identity stores. For more information<a href="http://www.appliedidentity.com/products/id-unify"> click here</a>. </li><li><strong>ID-Enforce</strong> is an identity

     aware, network enforcement solution that ties access policies with user

     network identity and network resources, for authorization and audit of

     network activities. ID-Enforce sits inline, close to the resources it

     protects which ensures that all users must pass through it in order to

     access data and applications. For more information<a href="http://www.appliedidentity.com/products/id-enforce"> click here</a>.</li><li><strong>ID-Mark</strong> In environments

     that require an increased level of accountability and non-repudiation of

     events, an optional ID-Mark™ driver can be installed on the client

     workstation to enhance security and enable the seamless collection of

     audit data. For more information <a href="http://www.appliedidentity.com/products/id-mark">click here</a>.</li></ul>

<p></p>
<p>For over ten years, I’ve watched the government spend

millions of dollars on two things:&nbsp;

identity management and cross domain access.&nbsp; I’ve seen prime contractors win contract

after contract, only to deliver nothing of real value.&nbsp; When I look at FedBizOpps, I see RFI after

RFI seeking information about protecting CUI and SBU information.&nbsp; It has always seemed that the problem was either

you protect it or share it, but not both; it was an all or nothing system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, we’ve been working on some military programs with

a company called Applied Identity, which has two pieces that have made life

much easier in regards to identity enforcement (who sees what) and cross domain

unification (who can get access to other sets of data they have a legitimate

need to see).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Programs like RAILHEAD and others that have failed to allow

its users to see and share data because of an inability to accurately enforce

identity management and connect the dots between disparate domains.&nbsp; In simplest terms, Applied Identity’s

capability fixes those problems and at a fraction of the cost.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The recovery funds are to be utilized to Create/Retain Jobs with&nbsp;law enforcement being a top priority. Should we not apply these funds to local government entities that are facing budget shortfalls and planning RIF's of established employees?

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I would like to see Medicare &amp; Medicaid inegrating operations where someone can retreive records and see their information in a centralized location.

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This could allow for more ease for people who want to save time and not call multiple people. This could be "green" because it would reduce the paper required to file certain documents. As the "baby boomers" start to retire we will actually start spending more money to assist those people who need to apply for benefits.&nbsp; If we can start this soon we can start saving money.</p>

				A common mans glance at what these recovery measures mean to me
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>In a world where large numbers are lost on the common man , a breakdown and visual/ graphic review of what all these dollars amount to for the average "Joe Blow" citizen becomes paramount. It is said the journey of a thousand miles begins with but one foot step. Well the revitalization of our economy starts with the 1st dollar for Mr. and Mrs. American. It is the reverse theory of the can't see the forest for the trees. The problem is so large that many citizens are overwhelmed by the numbers. We talk of visibility and open accountability but if&nbsp;no one can see beyond the complexity then the point , hope and aspiration are all lost.</p>
<p>Correlation to one person gives empathetic hope to us all. We as&nbsp;collective social animals need to see the fruits of the labor expounded upon another of our kind. I may not be the one receiving the rewards of the individual gain via the stimulus money but I need to hear the stories of those who do ..or like me who will.</p>
<p>If charity really begins at home then let's start in the family nucleus. Let's virtually hear and see the impact on our individual selves. Let's hear and publish the gripping stories of how the little lady in Virginia was saved from being put out of her family home of six generations of hard working Americans.</p>
<p>In the&nbsp;minority communities&nbsp;"economic stimulus" has been but a faint toll of a distant bell that has always been just a promise away. Well now is the time to let economic freedoms (case by case) ring. Individualism serves as a great light upon a hill beckoning for the huddled masses to march forward and come forth into the light of anticipated renewal. The plight that grips my fellowman must be exposed and then corrected to bring about hope.</p>
<p>My point beyond this is that in this state of economy with its massive negative numbers , the answer is sometimes as simple as 1 + 1 equals 2. The key is the "+" /plus ...it implies the positive to the situation verses the indignation and humiliation of the negative counter balance in the whole equation. 16 trillion is a number I will never fathom but&nbsp;I am more than willing to see or hear about my neighbor who got an extra $30 dollars from the office of Senior Citizens to buy fruit and vegetables for their families.</p>
<p>Let's simplify and make it real for the US public....at some point we will realize its not a bailout from the government but a suggestion to reach into your own pockets and "reach one to teach one" that I am my brothers keeper and I need to hear and see what's going on with him on a single level before&nbsp; I can comprehend his connected and complicated circumstances. I need to see the statistics on the ONE !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The needs of the one sometimes out weights the needs of the many. It is important to see the facts and the figures but it is even more important to see the power in the one. The scriptures says "and a child shall lead them" ....because it is in the simplistic and honest voice of a child we hear reason....and gain understanding !</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Many educated citizens in the United States of America may remember about the first amendment freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, and petition the government for a redress of grievances. This is what our constitution holds the most important. When the constitution was written, there was no concept of computer software and how it would affect the world.<br /><br />The culture of Free Software has four freedoms defined throughout the world wide web with a clear, concise definition.<br /><br /><a class="external-link" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a><br /><a class="external-link" href="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition">http://freedomdefined.org/Definition</a><br /><br /></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>If we are given the result of software freedom, I believe we have the

potential for greater things. In my view free software guarantees that

our children will have the software we had. It guarantees that people

everywhere will be able to make new software and devices by studying

and improving the old. It guarantees that greater competition will

exist as our ability to take advantage in customizing the software, as

we see fit, is at its full advantage. <br />
<br />

Even beyond the ideal of software with open source programming code,

these ideals of Free Software ensure the freedoms of the computer users

and enrich us with the most important parts of our technical progress.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>All agencies receiving ARRA and TARP funds are required to implement the following:</p>

<p>The first reaction is to create separate, new,&nbsp; system to perform these tasks. Instead, agencies could utilize their existing time and attendance system to perform these activities.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>By utilizing and enhancing the current time and attendance systems, agencies can reduce overhead and setup costs for ARRA and TARP support.

<h1>
				Reporting Waste &amp; Inefficiency should be Easy and Safe
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Recovery.gov should provide an easy <strong>and safe</strong> way for&nbsp;people who want to report waste, fraud &amp; abuse (or just plain inefficiency) with respect to Recovery spending.</p>
<p><strong>As President Obama recently stated</strong>, the people who are closest to the work are the ones most likely to see the waste and inefficiency in that work.</p>
<p>And, with respect to&nbsp;Recovery spending, that means employees of government (federal, state, &amp; local), <em>as well as employees of&nbsp;contractors to government</em>.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>,&nbsp;those employees will not&nbsp;report waste&nbsp;or inefficiency&nbsp;if <strong>(1)</strong>&nbsp;they are unaware or confused about&nbsp;how to&nbsp;report it, or if <strong>(2)</strong> there is&nbsp;a risk that&nbsp;they will <strong>lose their job&nbsp;for making the report.</strong></p>
<p>Yes,&nbsp;the traditional "whistleblower protections" for federal employees are now also&nbsp;extended to contractor employees under the&nbsp;the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ("ARRA").&nbsp; But <em><strong>those "protections" are so weak</strong></em> that only the most naive of federal employees&nbsp;actually believe that they work. &nbsp;(The wise ones have seen what really happens to the "whistleblowers".)</p>
<p>However, now there is technology that Recovery.gov can use that&nbsp;allows a person to report waste or inefficiency AND, at the same time, gives them sufficient&nbsp;confidence that they will not be "found out" by their supervisors.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about the "old"&nbsp;system offered by the govt. IGs or the GAO's Fraudnet, who expect&nbsp;the employee&nbsp;to trust their career to a complete stranger.&nbsp; I'm talking about outside-the-government vendors whose technology&nbsp;(and reputation) offer employees <strong>the level of control and confidentiality needed</strong> before they will "blow the whistle"&nbsp;on their organization.</p>
<p>I don't have a list of these vendors (nor do I work for any of them), but I know that some of them are on the GSA's list of pre-approved vendors (i.e., a federal agency could purchase their services very quickly).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CEO of one of those vendors has a blog-posting about the <a class="external-link" href="http://tinyurl.com/dhxjfq">ARRA's&nbsp;legal requirements for a&nbsp;whistleblowing system </a>needed by public and private organization that receive Recovery funds.&nbsp; Recovery.gov should provide&nbsp;an easy-to-understand "FAQs" on that topic (with links)&nbsp;for the benefit of those employers and employees.</p>
<p>In fact, <strong>it would be a very powerful symbol</strong> if the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB) itself adopted this better-than-legal system for people to report (confidentially or not) opportunities for improvement in the RATB's operations (including&nbsp;Recovery.gov) and not just limit it to&nbsp;a&nbsp;one-time, one-week window (like&nbsp;this platform).</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Any auditor will tell you that the single biggest source for detecting waste, fraud &amp; abuse (in any organization) comes from "tips" and information provided by the employees who see it.</p>
<p>If we make it easy and&nbsp;<strong>and safe</strong> for employees to make those reports, then&nbsp;more of them will do so which, in turn, will be the <strong><em>single biggest deterrent to waste, fraud and abuse</em></strong> (and, yes, just plain inefficiency) in the use of Recovery&nbsp;funds.</p>

<h1>
				Recovery.gov - Data Confusion or Data in Context?
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>As the central clearinghouse for all recovery related data, Recovery.gov has been tapped with managing and storing large amounts of data reported back by state and local governments on their recovery initiatives.&nbsp; It is not just storage of data that Recovery.gov is tasked with but also making this data available to interested individuals.&nbsp; Foremost amongst the interested parties, is the public, our citizens. How can they can get relevant, content rich information out of Recovery.gov.? To illustrate this, let’s imagine how a citizen might interact with Recovery.gov.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joe Q. Public lives in an area with high unemployment and a challenging housing market.&nbsp; It’s been a few months since ARRA was passed and he doesn't see a lot activity but there has been some press on the subject lately.&nbsp; It seems that the unemployment rate is falling and housing sales are up in the region.&nbsp; One of Joe's elected representatives went so far as to say "We've gotten an above average share of ARRA funds and things are getting better at an above average rate."&nbsp; Joe seems to remember the same exuberance in the past, so he decides to head to Recovery.gov and see what he can discover for himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once at Recovery.gov, Joe discovers that there is lots of data about his area and he can down load all of it.&nbsp; Wow, that's openness and transparency; he can't wait to get started.&nbsp; First hurdle, he's working at the library and they've restricted people's ability to down load data to the computer, you have to have a memory stick.&nbsp; The librarian explains that those are the policies but, in the interest of our story, lends him a memory stick.&nbsp;&nbsp; He busily starts to download the unemployment data, the housing data and the ARRA funding data to the borrowed stick.&nbsp; Once Joe opens the files he sees that they are all long lists of numbers that are separated by commas.&nbsp; What to do?&nbsp; Our friendly librarian helps Joe to copy the data to a spreadsheet and now he can see some of the measures associated with his region.&nbsp; The problem is that the data doesn't match up, some data is at the state level, some at the county level, FIPS County code, census track code.&nbsp; The data is also for different periods of time: quarterly, monthly, weekly.&nbsp; There's the data - open, transparent and useless. How to put all of this together?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an alternative, think about Recovery.gov as an information portal built upon and supported with Business Intelligence.&nbsp; IBM Cognos can provide a Business Intelligence platform that is open, standards-based and flexible.&nbsp; Recovery.gov built on Business Intelligence can make Joe Q. Public's experience very different.&nbsp; Joe logs onto Recovery.gov and finds his state.&nbsp; From his state, Joe enters his county, housing starts and unemployment into a search box.&nbsp; IBM Cognos, and its integration with search, returns a list of results that include some charts and maps of Joe's county, Joe chooses a map view of his area that shows housing starts.&nbsp; Given the increased # of homes on the market, it actually looks like sales % has been flat – it is not getting better, but it has leveled off.&nbsp; Joe copies the link of his analysis and posts it to the blog of his local TV station.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, Joe chooses to swap the map for a table of data and he adds unemployment rates to the table. He makes an interesting discovery: it looks like a spike in unemployment is a leading indicator for problems in housing.&nbsp; Looking at the recent data, there seems to be a downward movement in unemployment but 3 months is not a trend.&nbsp; Joe emails himself a copy of his analysis so that he can come back to it in the future and see if the numbers have changed.&nbsp; Joe's pleased that Recovery.gov had given him the tools that he needed to take the raw data and turn it into the information that he wanted.&nbsp; Not a bad day at the library...</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Guided exploration with context.&nbsp; This is what our citizens need.&nbsp; IBM Cognos can provide just such a platform.&nbsp; Since the information is modeled and presented to users with a drag and drop interface, citizens need not know how Counties and Census tracts relate to each other.&nbsp; Remove the complexity and manage it so that the user has the easiest experience possible.&nbsp; IBM Cognos provides citizen-centric reporting by providing guided exploration that pertains to all dimensions of information, regardless of where the data is stored. Users can perform complex analysis quickly and easily to get to the “why” behind the recovery data. Analyze data that's automatically organized in logical categories such as congressional district, investment category, progress of projects etc. Users can easily slice and dice the data and drill into details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have many existing citizen centric websites including the following:</p>
<p>Colorado School Accountability Reports: http://reportcard.cde.state.co.us/reportcard/CommandHandler.jsp</p>
<p>OPM: http://www.fedscope.opm.gov/;</p>
<p>City of Albequrque: http://cogpub.cabq.gov/cognos8/cgi-bin/cognos.cgi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is it important?&nbsp; Recovery.gov can provide knowledge and information built upon the data that can be viewed, analyzed and shared via the web or it can house raw data. Raw data that will increase the likelihood that multiple versions of the truth will be sold and reported on and that Joe Q. Public will still be at the library with open, transparent and useless data files.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Mobile devices, such as cell phones and portable music players, have varied abilities to interact with outside sources.&nbsp;Cell phones can interact with SMS, Twitter, web sites, calendars, and more.

<p>The information from Recovery.gov should be accessible to mobile devices using their native capabilities (SMS, email, CalDAV, SyncML, WWW, WAP, etc.), and should allow for a two-way conversation. But we should also look to the benign hacking community for ideas about stretching the limits of these devices to bring information to citizens.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Mobile devices are near-ubiquitous and much of the population spends a lot of time with them. They are more common and less expensive than personal computers, and offer a way to reach a large group of people.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Organizations receiving recovery funds should be required to provide proof that they are effectively overseeing and monitoring the way these funds are being spent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control provides a list of people and organizations that companies should not trade with - i.e organized crime, drug cartels, terrorists, etc.&nbsp; Similarly there are companies that have been debarred, or forbidden to be contracted for future goods and services.&nbsp; Receiving parties should be required to have effective controls in place and proof that they are monitoring these controls to ensure that recovery money is not going towards these organizations.</p>
<p>Similarly, effective data analysis techniques should be used to monitor the efficiency of spending - making sure that contract terms are followed, duplicate payments are not made, fair market prices are being charged.</p>
<p>Data analysis should also be used to ensure that spending is not subject to fraud.&nbsp; Simple tests can be used to ensure that receiving organizations are not be defrauded by employees or contracting organizations.&nbsp; Numerous data analysis techniques can be used to identify fraudsters by matching addresses, bank accounts for payments, transactions outside of statistical norms, ensuring that goods paid for are received, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Excellent guidance on the use of technology for overseeing financial transactions can be found from The Institute of Internal Auditors, (The IIA) and similarly the Association of Certifed Fraud Examiners (ACFE) has a wealth of information on fraud detection and prevention programs.&nbsp; Data analysis technology is key in enabling best practices in these areas and needs to be implemented from the outset to set the tone for recovery spending activities.<br /></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This idea is important to ensure that we get the most out of our recovery funds and allow them to have the intended affect on our economy.&nbsp; It is also key in demonstrating effective management and oversight of taxpayers money, in order to instill a degree of confidence in local leadership in showing the way forward.</p>

				Time, Geo, and Multimodal Data Viz on Recovery.gov
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.recovery.gov">www.recovery.gov</a> is a great start to actually give life and breadth to the ARRA, its funds, distribution, etc. The website provides some good visualizations of ARRA but not enough. High quality visuals are eye-catching, can be thought-provoking, and ultimately can enable transparency to ARRA. We need more and they need to be more fun, informative, and share-able.</p>
<p>We (<a class="external-link" href="http://piim.newschool.edu">The Parsons Institute for Information Mapping</a>)&nbsp;propose extending the usefulness and interactivity of the site's existing information graphics and provide American citizens the ability to visualize the true spend and success of these funds. We need to unite these datasets and visuals into comprehensive and interactive graphics.</p>
<p>Leveraging the info. graphics on the <a href="http://www.recovery.gov">www.recovery.gov</a> homepage and incorporating the datasets everyone here is talking about sharing can give some really powerful visualizations - visuals that people will remember, share with friends/colleagues, and help foster the national discussion while supporting transparency.</p>
<p><strong>Some examples of work we've done that can be very helpful:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Public Opinion Tool</strong> (<a href="http://www.publicopiniontool.org">http://www.publicopiniontool.org</a>) - a web-based tool that educates K-12 students about the electoral process through visualiation and interactivity.</p>
<p><strong>The Geospace and Media Tool</strong> (<a href="http://piim.newschool.edu/development/geospace-and-media-tool">http://piim.newschool.edu/development/geospace-and-media-tool</a>) - a Section 508/web-based tool for members of US Congress to assess, analyze, and visualize streaming news, demographic, social network, geospatial, and other datasets in a single system.</p>
<p>We focus on finding, designing,&nbsp;and engineering innovative visualizations and <a href="http://www.recovery.gov">www.recovery.gov</a> can benefit with a collaboration betwen us and <a class="external-link" href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a> and others (e.g. <a class="external-link" href="http://www.visualanalytics.com">Visual Analytics, Inc</a>., IBM [<a class="external-link" href="http://www.many-eyes.com">Many Eyes</a>], etc.).</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p><strong>Having time-based, geographic-based, and multi-modal (e.g. same data different representation) can help Americans of many backgrounds understand ARRA in their own way. Providing various representations enables communication to a wider audience and helps "speak" to each and every citizen.</strong></p>

<p>The biggest barrier to communicating information and trends

geospatially is how difficult and costly it is for most people or organizations

to translate their data into a communicative geospatial form. When it is done, the

result is usually a static map or one that is somewhat interactive but

difficult to use or share. This creates a huge barrier to knowledge sharing and

collaboration. We have just released a free beta version of a product

that addresses these issues. We would love feedback from those who have information they would like to more easily translate into

and share in a geospatial form. Please sign up for the beta and try it - we think our offering can make a

significant contribution to the work of this community - spatialkey.com</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Enabling regular people - non GIS analysts and professionals - to create and share location based information easily will accelerate information sharing, contextual analysis and community collaboration. It will help unlock information critical to the core issues facing our society and government. It will help facilitate more informed interactive dialog among mutiple stakeholders resulting in faster, better informed decision making.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Currently the plan includes partial payment of COBRA costs of unemployed workers to be paid by the government.&nbsp; I feel the funds provided should be broken down by the amounts insurance providers have received compared to the amouunt of lobbying money they spend.</p>

<h1>
				Reporting Expenditure of Construction Funds
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have an idea that won't require creation of a single additional piece of paper. How about assigning a unique identifying number to each individual project funded in whole or in part by these appropriations. Create a database attaching the identifier with the brief project description already included in the front end of every government construction contract. Then, link the identifier to .pdf copies of the contractor's sworn statement and lien waivers already submitted with each monthly pay request on every government construction job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This way, citizens interested in the progress and efficiency of any particular project could quickly drill down to a complete list of every business that was paid any money for labor or materials on the project. Furthermore, neither the bureaucrats nor the contractors on the project would have to write up a single document they are not already required to prepare. As far as I can tell all this information is already required to be public under the freedom of information laws in every state anyway, so no one's toes get stepped on, and no one has to do any extra work. Just run the sworn statements and lien waivers through a scanner every month and e-mail them to Devaney's folks in Washington, D.C. for electronic insertion into the database. Nobody even has to spend money on stamps. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Nobody has to create any reports or dopcuments which aren't already needed and used in the payment process, and payment details are immediately accessible to the public.</p>

<p>Use a Research Management Solution (RMS) to track the due

diligence performed by the government agencies tasked with distributing

stimulus funds. An RMS can systematically capture and organize the unstructured

information required for the analysis of stimulus investments. RMS has been

successfully adopted by money managers all over the globe as a way to create an

open and transparent collaboration among analysts, power better choices for

decision-makers, and create a structured audit trail of analysis.</p>

<p>99% of the world's information is unstructured: email

correspondence, documents, spreadsheets, slide decks. While quantitative

analysis is critical, many of the most important decisions are driven by human

discourse – in words not just numbers. Research Management Solutions transform

the cacophony of disparate email inboxes and shared drives into a structured

database shared in real time across global organizations. To provide complete

transparency for the public, the agencies responsible for application of stimulus

funds need to track their internal assessments. These assessments will include

large bodies of correspondence and prose analysis. Research Management

Solutions can transform the potentially chaotic investment research process

into a coherent, organized, and agency-wide effort.<strong></strong></p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Recovery.gov will more then likely be a very complex interwoven set of enterprise service buses (ESBs) and applications.&nbsp; The chance of all&nbsp;applications playing nicely are probably remote.&nbsp; Of course that is the fun part!!</p>
<p>To support such an environment I would normally recommend a hosted private cloud which allows the cloud owners to make the needed alterations without impacting other members of the cloud.&nbsp; Part of that flexibility can be to reach out to a public clould if needed for peak hours of performance A.K.A Hybrid Cloud</p>
<p>In a particular use case, some applications may be to complex or sensitive to run on a public cloud. In that case&nbsp;applications that can be migrated&nbsp;could be moved to a public cloud and then those resources can be repurposed&nbsp;for&nbsp;the complex apps that need to stay home.</p>
<p>I have to give props to a good friend of mine who thought of this a few weeks back when we were brain storming on cloud use cases.&nbsp;</p>

				Trust Enablement Infrastructure: a Trust Keystone System
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>You asked: "What do you consider to be the most exciting upcoming technology or

system in the field of managing, aggregating, and visualizing diverse

types of data?"</p>
<p>In short, my proposal is a <strong>Trust Keystone System</strong>.&nbsp; It is a Trust Enablement® infrastructure component that supports all information within the recovery.org ecosystem (analogous to, but not the same as, a generalized eBay infrastructure stripped of the auction and buy-now applications).</p>
<p>Trust Enablement® is a proactive, strategic approach to designing business processes that give stakeholders the confidence they need to take consequential actions, such as relying on the validity of information about how the recovery and investment money is being used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trust Enablement® is used by organizations in technologies and business processes to help them achieve their business goals by optimizing the trust of their stakeholders. Trust Enabled™ business practices reduce transaction costs and enhance business value in areas as diverse as supply chain management and corporate governance.<br /><br />Trust Enablement® is both a management philosophy and a technology for business best practices. It fills a business practices void by counterbalancing risk management based control mechanisms that preserve trust, with those that develop trust, and thereby provides a complementary, foundational, new management competency. It serves to fundamentally change the leadership mindset from an inside-out to an outside-in orientation.<br /><br />Trust Enablement® has broad applicability, similar to risk management, but its value to business and government is far greater. Whereas risk management is defensively minded and preservation oriented, Trust Enablement® is offensive and growth oriented.&nbsp; For more information about Trust Enablement® visit our web site at <a class="external-link" href="http://TrustEnablement.com">http://TrustEnablement.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Although "<em>accountability</em>" and "<em>transparency</em>" are the stated goals of

the President's Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, I would

argue that the overriding objective is <em>trust</em> (this is supported by

other idea contributors, including IBM).&nbsp; However, <em>accountability</em> and <em>transparency</em> are insufficient conditions for <em>trust</em>, as per our Trust Enablement® Framework.&nbsp; The Trust Enablement® Framework should guide development of a Trust Enablement Infrastructure, an integral part of the larger conceptual model used to guide strategic deployment of the site's functionality.&nbsp; A robust conceptual model allows management to make more complete decisions about which tools and process are needed to support the stated mission of recovery.org.&nbsp; In the absence of a blueprint to guide development the basis for relying on the information will be inconsistent, which will erode

confidence and undermine the effort.&nbsp; Moreover, there is a danger that

over-reliance on <em>transparency</em> and <em>accountability</em>, both critical but

insufficient components of a comprehensive Trust Enablement®

Infrastructure, can cause management to take their eyes off the ball and miss the

overriding objective.&nbsp; We must guard against the tendency of the vast majority to think exclusively about the IT elements for the solution, which can be shortsighted; reinforcing conventional wisdom and the status quo that results in fragmentation.</p>
<p>To further support my recommendation, I would direct you to recent polls I conducted that revealed management may not have sufficient competency in enabling trust.&nbsp; See "Insiders' Poll on Trust in Online Social Networks" (<a class="external-link" href="http://trustenablement.com/OSN_Trust_Poll-SummaryData.pdf">summary data</a> and <a class="external-link" href="http://trustenablement.com/Insiders_Poll_on_Trust_in_OSNs-PreliminaryFindings.pdf">finding</a>) and answers to a recent poll asking "<a class="external-link" href="http://trustenablement.blogspot.com/2009/04/results-from-stakeholder-trust-poll-of.html">What should business leaders do to improve stakeholder trust?</a>".&nbsp; I also analyzed Canada's Federal Accountability Act (similarly misnamed) to determine the extent to which it contributed to restoring trust in the wake of a high profile government fraud, and found that the term "<em>accountability</em>" may have caused the program to overemphasize protecting over rebuilding trust (see my article "<a class="external-link" href="http://trustenablement.com/local/Creating_trust_in_government.pdf">Restoring Trust in Government is more than Cleaning House</a>".&nbsp; The same was to true when I analyzed Sarbanes-Oxley Legislation in my paper "<a class="external-link" href="http://trustenablement.com/local/Trust_Enabled_Corporate_Governance.pdf">Trust Enabled Corporate Governance</a>". In support of my position that trust should be an explicit consideration that can and should be addressed systemically, I would direct you to my contributions to the Conference Board of Canada's reports on stakeholder trust at <a class="external-link" href="http://trustenablement.com/index.htm#StakeholderTrust">http://trustenablement.com/index.htm#StakeholderTrust</a>.&nbsp; Finally, beware of vendors promoting myopic solutions as per <a class="external-link" href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/EndToEndTrust/thread/60502672-288e-41dc-ab0a-2a65c2d8d6dd">my comments on Microsoft's End-to-End Trust initiative</a>.</p>
<p>How can a system intended to develop trust that does not explicitly and competently address trust considerations be expected to have the desired outcome?&nbsp; What's your counter proposal?<br /></p>

<h1>
				Concerns About Choosing Rural Broadband Awards
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The task of choosing rural broadband awards will be daunting.&nbsp; Up to this point in time as an example, RUS has awarded loans &amp; grants that equal nearly the amount that is being asked to be awarded in 2 years.&nbsp; That would infere that to follow the Administration's mandate for dispersing funds, it would behoove the USDA &amp; NTIA to grant LARGE project awards to more easily utilize manpower to evaluate award performance that has to pass in front of Congress for reviews.&nbsp; The obvious bias will be towards larger companies and that will not necessarily give rural areas the coverage that they desperately need.&nbsp; Smaller companies with appropriate business plans will be more inclined and more familiar with covering Rural America in high-speed broadband.&nbsp; If the major companies had business plans to cover rural areas, they would have already accomplished the task.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Rural America will be better served by dispersing a majority of the Simulus Funds to smaller, rural Companies.&nbsp; RUS will have to significantly change their review and acceptance process in order to get the funds out where they are needed.&nbsp; Let's not just look at what they have awarded, also review how much money was actually dispersed.&nbsp; Change the criteria to 10% instead of 20% for a business-match requirement.</p>

<p>Use rich internet application technology like silverlight / WPF / Flash to improve the data visualization like Map(GIS) base drill down, category or department based drill down along with multiple graphs / charts to provide an intuitive insight about the huge amount of data published regularly by the web sites.</p>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Data visualization is very important whenever insight is required from huge amounts of data. If regular people are not able to find the right insight from the data provided, it won't be useful in finding the inefficiencies in the process / project. I think it'll make huge differrence if more people are able to derive insight from the data and able to understand and compare the data to report the inconsistancies in the spending and implementations of the project.</p>

<p>We are a safety equipment manufacturing concern and this week alone have had 15 calls from businesses wanting a price for a govt. Dept of Homeland Security dept. for our product. Why not just go straight to the manufacturer and find out what they will sell direct to the government for instead of putting out all of these bids.

				repairing the home loan for the economy
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I believe obama has a good idea about restucturing the loan system, I think people that are having problem keeping their home because of the economy should have the chance to keep the house with a new estimate on what their property is really worth in this economy the tax assessors office should reassess property. and then give the people that have invested their whole lives to get buy a home get the benefit of help rather than a stranger that has no investment reap the benefits. I personally know of two youg couples that had homes in the price rang of half a million or more lose their homes due to the econmy. Those kids should have had the same opportunity to fefinance the house or make a deal with the bank like a stranger did to buy the home short sale they put in on the market for over $500,000.00 it sold for approximately $250,000.00, why could'nt the bank gave those kids the same opportunity</p>
<p>to keep their home they both work but the husband worked in construction and lost his job for a whil and then went back to work for less money. they were not lazy people looking for a hand out. give the people a break all the senator if they had to live on $673.00 a month on SSI I would really like to see them have to try and pay rent and utilities and necessities, when necessities are rising as fast as everthing except wages, WAGES are the only thing losing ground in this country unless you happen to be a senator or a bank administrator. that is something else no senators should get cost of living increases when they make over $100,000.00 a year nor bank presidents, nor anyone else in any industry with goverment funds untilthe pooest of people have a livable income. and they limit what you can own as well like cars, how many of you don't have two cars so if one breaks down you have access to another one to get you to the hospital or work which ever the situation may be and why does it matter what it is worth if that is all they have when they get on aid. you have to sell a dependable car to get a junker to qualify? that is a joke I worked for the welfare dept for a while and they make liars out of honest people to get help, they make wifes lie saying their husbands no longer live with them to get any help if they have anything instead of helping them get on their feet again. if you have never been on the other side of that counter you should have to try it before you make those laws so you understand how ridiculous they are half the time no one knows how to implement the new rules and before they get a chance for the lawyers or whoever makes them to tell you how they work they have changed them again.&nbsp; Get some people that understand how the system really works to make some of the laws. the people tht use them everyday and see the way the system is abused by ilegal aliens having a english speaking alien translate for someone that does not to someone that does not speak the language and to give them medical benefits and food stamps for children that were born here illegally because ther parents were here ilegally is crazy no wonder this nation is in the condition it is if the parents are not legal the children shoul'nt be either no matter where they are born.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Because everyone suffers from what is happening when I say everyone I mean the taxpayers of the united states,I have no problem with letting mexican come into the united states they have more rights to be here than the orientals, Vietnamese Germans, Russians that have never worked a day in the united states and yet they are more entitled than the people that were born and raised here, the government is bringing them in at an astounding rate I assume, that it is all political reasons but that certainly does not help our economy and it makes the people that their family have been here for a couple hundred of years and pay taxes angry, especially when they have projects like W&gt;A&gt;I&gt;V&gt;E</p>
<p>for aliens brought in by our government and not give us the same respect and money for education why is that? why do they give foreigners more help than the citizens that pay the money they use to implement those plans.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I would suggest establishing a network with Naturopathic and Chiropractic Colleges across the country, along with their&nbsp;doctors,&nbsp;to assess the needs of these particular medical communities and those they would be able to serve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give this network&nbsp;connection and establishment&nbsp;with other medical communties and the public at large, to work in conjuntion with the department of Health Resources and Services Administration.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>For far too long these doctors and clinicians have been out of the government loop, whether it be in the areas of insurance coverage or acceptance in the broader community of hospitals and Allopathic Physicians.</p>
<p>Assessment could be encouraged about the needs for hospital grants to allow for internship programs and for college loan&nbsp;grant or debt forgiveness, through&nbsp;placement commitments&nbsp;in local communties lacking family care physicians accessability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this network had access to other networks with hospitals and government programs for such and in general with local medical communities, funding could be directed to those localities most in need, with critical shortages of Family Physicians&nbsp;and other medical practitioners.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The Recovery&nbsp;Accountability and Transparency Board is considering all options for&nbsp;open-source research, fund tracking, and&nbsp;predictive analysis tools.&nbsp; Can you please provide solution ideas for the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Open-Source Research -</strong> Currently, the private sector is using open-source information as a cornerstone of its risk-based strategies&nbsp;(e.g., only pulling from&nbsp;public databases, news sources, internet sites, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;The RATB&nbsp;should employ these tools to allow&nbsp;for transparency among all recipients.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Funds Tracking -</strong>&nbsp;Never before has there been such a huge data set (Recovery Funds)&nbsp;so conspicuously labeled for accountability.&nbsp; Tools that will help the public see the funding all the way down to the final user would be a great addition for transparency.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Predictive&nbsp;Analytics –</strong> <em>We need to do what we can to prevent fraud before it happens</em>.&nbsp; There are very comprehensive tools that&nbsp;focus&nbsp;on complex data streams using visualization for risk-based targeting of potential fraud.&nbsp; These tools are commonly used among the credit card, banking and credit bureau industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				Provide a friendly visual user interface to government data 
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Government agencies hold Terabytes of data that is inaccessible to users in its native format. A visual user paradigm enables a much broader set of users to access and understand the data, creating new opportunities for constituents to understand how and where their government is delivering services. Agencies can use public services where available, in combination with their own data to create new visually consumable content.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>It is not enough to simply provide data to constituents. Data should be presented with context in order to make it effective and understandable. An easy way to do this is by providing a visual interface utilizing existing investments and data. There are solutions available today that make data more effective with little development work and utilizing existing infrastructure within government agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of where existing investments can be applied to provide a more effective view of the data is Microsoft’s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/industry/government/solutions/Single_View_Platform/default.aspx" target="_blank"><u>Single View Platform</u></a>. This solution makes use of capabilities that agencies already possess coupled with public service mapping capabilities to deliver a geographic view of complex information and data sets across multiple roles and location. The Single View Platform provides:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comprehensible visual presentation of data.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access to real-time or near real-time information.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integration of multiple information sets from disparate sources.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing information inside and outside the agency, with restricted access controls.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interoperability with existing and legacy systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Single View Platform solution can be deployed using the existing agency investments coupled with public data services to enable transparency and accountability quickly with limited additional expense.</p>

				USAC funding and audits
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I have 2 ideas related to USAC.</p>
<p>1. Let's increase the funding to area to assist in the area of medical advances. There is a BIG hole in the ideas going on for spending in telemedicine. I have seen a lot of great money being spend on equipment for expanding healthcare in rurual areas. It's GREAT! One big issue: The network in these areas can not support the equipment. The programs to help enable CT Scans, X-rays, and etc to be examined by a doctor out of the area is great! Too bad the clinic won't be able to pay the monthly bill to afford the circuit to support it.</p>
<p>2. There is a way to reduce spending at the FCC and Rural Health care to get the funds for the first point. The money, time and effort to submit forms for government healthcare sites is silly. Why should the Indian Health services or any other health care clinic have to go back and resubmit paperwork ever again? It's a health care site, it's rurual. Done, end of story. Instead, everytime the clinic needs a different carrier or upgrade the circuit go to resubmit. AND auditing? Why, for what? Where is the monies going to get spend? It's health care and it's getting paid to the telco. It's not the clinic get the money back from the telco. NOPE, it stays in the pot to go to "telco". What a weird waste of resources.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Health care in rurual locations is necessary. There are some many locations where people live 50 to 200 miles from a hospital. These clinics are all they have. Let's spend the monies wisely.</p>

<p>The Federal Agencies and Bureaus assigned responsibility for their parts of the ARRA need to fully follow the law in managing their organization's <strong>information resources</strong>, not just their information technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most effective and efficient means of managing information resources is to use a consistent "terminology" method across all of those organizations.&nbsp; See the other ideas on this site relating to terminology (including enterprise architecture), as the basis for a consistent organization management life cycle, as the basis for consistent management controls, as the means to achieve appropriately secured and shared operational transparency, accountability, and discipline.</p>
<p>The CIO's need to establish the mechanism for organization terminology (methodology, metamodel, supporting technology, infrastructure), while the Chief of Staff or equivalent would be responsible for its cross-organization content and use, and the IG and auditors would use it to ensure effective and efficient organization, functional, program, and project operations management, and the contribution that the governed terminology makes to that management success.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Create a GIS Spatial View that stitches local layers into a national layer.</p>
<p>This would allow a person to view local data from local agencies simillarly to a quilted blanket. You would just have to add one thing to your map like land parcels or streets and internally the spatial view would stitch all the local layers together for you so you can analyze it as needed.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Government is currently funding the creation of things like the same land parcels and streets within multiple agencies at the same time. Let's stop funding that and fund the local agencies so they can feed up to the national level. Our world changes every day and the local level is the place to best capture the updates. For example the CENSUS could reference a "Live" view of where they need to go. Add in a "Live" view of satellite imagery with a three inch pixel size as a background and you have a great operational stage to work upon.</p>

				 Agencies/ Temp.co. prevents Citizens to get jobs hiring H1 Visas, Why?
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Thank you for the feedback.<br />We have to do a lot, train Amercan Citizens for Job readiness in various fields,because millions of H! Visa holders in USA working for agencies / Temp. companies occupying high positions and jobs.&nbsp; The Agencies are hiring H1 visa holders and sending them to various&nbsp; companies and&nbsp; getting their high income. This&nbsp;Prevents &nbsp;US Citizens&nbsp; getting jobs because of all these Agencies.<br />The Government has to do great a lot to stop this.All Agencies/Temp.agencies &nbsp;should hire Citizens instead of temportary H1 Visas and other illegal imigrants.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p><strong><em>There are millions of H 1 Visa Holders working hired by Agnecies and&nbsp; Temporary companies&nbsp;supporting &nbsp;this temps. Visa holders, paying attorney fees to help getting Green cards.These agencies ignore&nbsp; Citizens&nbsp; and makie tons of&nbsp; money and helping temp. visa holders. The agencies throughout United states. </em></strong></p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest that the the weekly reports by the different federal Agencies be a continued document, with most recent&nbsp; updates posted at the top.</p>
<p>Also, provide a meaning for the codes WITH the dollar amounts.</p>

<p>Rather than opening a new document eachtime and having to review what

				Road Condition Monitoring
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Our country's transportation infrastructure and our roadways in particular our one of our most valuable assets, yet the way roadway improvements are proposed, monitored and implemented are often through an antiquated process based upon mid 20th century policies and procedures. With the technology available today States could implement enterprise-wide road condition monitoring solutions that better track and project road conditions and allow departments of transportation to better invest resources in a more targeted fashion.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Currently hundreds of millions of dollars each year could be recovered by focusing resources where they are really needed rather than allocating them by an outdated and inefficient schedule.</p>

				Report Multiple Bottom Lines - Take a page from the business world
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The citizen should not only be able to monitor the fiscal bottom line (where the money is going), but other bottom line impacts (e.g. number of jobs created, number of citizens positively impacted, demographics of those citizens). Forward thinking businesses already report&nbsp; their CSR (corporate social responsibility) metrics. There are data collection and reporting systems currently in production that demostrate how to collect information from mulitple organizations, validate and report against multiple bottom lines. An example is the Microfinance Information Exchange that leverages Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) to have institutions report both against both a financial and social bottom line. <a class="external-link" href="http://www.ubmatrix.com/casestudies/mix_page.htm">Read more here.</a></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Citizens should not only be able to see where the money is going, they should be able to understand the social impact of the money spent</p>

				Web Application to manage Stimulus Bill projects
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<div>Web based software to monitor the 

Stimulus Bill projects in various states, to ensure they are&nbsp;properly funded, 

managed and accounted for and are&nbsp;transparent to all&nbsp;interested parties. To 

assist in this endeavor, Level One Technologies&nbsp;has developed&nbsp;a web based 

application that&nbsp;will be modified to meet these requirements&nbsp;at the federal 

level and on a state by state basis.&nbsp;The application is an ASP, based on Epay 

Manager (<a>www.epaymanager.com</a>), a solution our company&nbsp;developed 

for the transportation industry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>To review the&nbsp;details of&nbsp;a proposal we've made 

to&nbsp;the state of Missouri, please use the&nbsp;following link:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a>http://issuu.com/levelonetechnologies/docs/transform20</a><a></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The new system will be available&nbsp;in 12 weeks and 

will&nbsp;allow&nbsp;the&nbsp;federal or any state government&nbsp;to 

enter and/or download Stimulus Bill projects and proposals,&nbsp;collect and store 

all related documents,&nbsp;track each proposal's&nbsp;progress through the review and 

approval process,&nbsp;using sequential approval chains and provide&nbsp;a mechanism for 

the state to collect and store post funding updates and documents required&nbsp;by 

the Federal government.&nbsp;The system&nbsp;will feature unique lists of transactions by 

status (pending, processing, approved, rejected, funded and completed); it&nbsp;has 

the ability to initiate funding using ACH transfers and offers a complete audit 

trail for each transaction. In addition,&nbsp;the system&nbsp;will offer&nbsp;a full&nbsp;range of 

search and reporting tools for both public and&nbsp;government use, with safeguards 

for&nbsp;documents that are not subject to sunshine&nbsp;law provisions. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The software is&nbsp;available&nbsp;for an annual licensing 

fee, plus the cost of any customizations that your agency may require.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please contact me at your earliest convenience to 

discuss whether&nbsp;this application&nbsp;can assist you in meeting&nbsp;your agency's 

Stimulus Bill reporting responsibilities.</div>
<div><br />Sincerely,</div>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The system will provide a universal platform for all states to register and manage their Stimulus Bill projects and make these projects viewable and transparent to the Federal government and to the public.</p>

				Leverage the INPUT procuremen reporting capability already being collected.
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The data collected needs to be from an existing source that Federal agencies are using.&nbsp; The FPDS-Next Generation system is such a system.&nbsp; I am aware that INPUT already utilizes this system to extrapolate their reporting for each of the Federal Agencies.&nbsp; If the Agencies are being directed to report the Recovery procurements in a distinct way then that data can be captured and reported.&nbsp; The Administration needs to start some level of partnership or consideration arrangement&nbsp;with INPUT so that a mass public audience could have visibility without the fee.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>There is a timeliness factor and the importance of veriable data.&nbsp; FPDS-NG is not perfect tool however it is an established and recognized tool that procurement professionals and OMB are familiar with.&nbsp; Introducing&nbsp; a new data source and reporting capability is not prudent with the timeframes needed for this undertaking.</p>

				Open an API fodevelopers to get data
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I think the best way to share information is to provide an API and allow developers/companies to consume the informaiton and present it in all different ways (Widgets, facebook, web , iphone , andorid, flash&nbsp; etc. etc. )</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>i would think that opening the api up would allow for open informaiton sharing for multiple platforms , this way the site would not have to build all of these applicaitons and allow for anyone to connect and get data and present it in any way .</p>

<h1>
				Alfresco for Web Site; Tableau for visualization; CMIS for data sharing; 
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><strong>Web Site CMS</strong> + <strong>Virtualized computing clouds</strong><br />Use the open source enterprise-grade content management system Alfresco for the Web site. Run it on virtual machines on private computing clouds (VMware vSphere 4) for maximum scalability. Couple that with Amazon computing cloud clusters to handle load spikes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tableau for data Visualization, Exploration &amp; Dashboards</strong><br />Use Tableau (server-based version) for the visualization of data. Work with Tableau and data visualization experts such as Edward Tufte to create analysis packagages for data visualization that can easily be manipulated by Joe data or experts. Deliver the raw data, but also deliver the tools to extend the utility of the data to a wider audience. Tableau provides tools to not only visualize data, but to explore the data.</p>
<p><strong>Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS)<br /></strong>CMIS or Content Management Interoperability Services, was proposed as a

draft standard in September 2008 and submitted to OASIS. Proposed by

the largest ECM vendors (IBM, EMC, Microsoft) It is based on REST and SOAP bindings for content exchange

between content repositories regardless of the ECM platform. This would

make it simple for multiple agencies to publish content on their own

sites and have it automatically be aggregated on a

single web presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alfresco is CMIS-capable<br /></strong>Alfresco supports CMIS. Given that it is open source, a content-delivery package could be created to be installed locally (or run on cloud services) by any agency. This would cut out redundant work to create infrastructure by each agency.</p>
<p>Alfresco supports ATOM, XForms, and has a light-weight scripting framework (SURF).&nbsp; The scripting framework can talk to the repository back-end; making it simple to create packaged web-applications that can be distributed quickly. In addition,being able to talk to repositories using CMIS would simplify the data integration problem.</p>
<p><strong>Alfresco is extensible</strong>; <strong>open source</strong><br />Engage the developer community to create a solution around an established enterprise-grade solution.</p>
<p><strong>Alfresco supports JBoss jBPM for packaged business processes</strong><br />Utilize jBoss jBPM that Alfresco uses for designing pre-packaged processes that support waste, fraud, and abuse detection.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>It combines open source and best-in-class resources to deliver a solution quickly.</p>

			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Treemaps offer a unique visualization for showing a comprehensive view of the Recovery spending while allowing for drill-down into the details. Here is an example that shows the Stimulus Bill composition alongside popularity of the components: http://stimulusbill.juiceanalytics.com/treemap</p>
<p>If this model was combined with views by agency and % disbursed, it could provide average visitors a way to navigate through all this data.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>My idea is to HOLD LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS OR LACK THEREOF. My state received $93 million in Energy recovery funding according the NE.gov website for low income asst and weatherization. Yet, despite my numerous emails to the Governor, local attempts for help, I haven't had any gas service or hot water nor heat for over two weeks now. It is bills or REVISED BILLS such as LB 288 or LB 626 or LB 237A for example where local officials cam "make up" their own "unethical" standards that needs to be brought up and held accountable under the ARRA PROGRAM. A person may want to look at 81-1506 as well.</p>
<p>I AM WONDERING IF THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE LEFT IN TODAY'S WORLD WHO ARE HONEST OR ETHICAL ENOUGH TO PUT HUMAN LIFE AND ETHICS AND MORALS ABOVE AND BEYOND MONEY AND POLITICS IN ORDER FOR THIS WHOLE ARRA THING TO WORK. I CERTAINLY PRAY TO GOD THERE IS FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN IN TODAY'S SOCIETY.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>even indigent people deserve basic human rights, such as hot water and heat, despite whether they have the money to pay their gas bill or not. this is what the government and the ARRA is SUPPOSED TO BE FOR.

THIS IS ABSURD... BUT YET , IT CONTINUES ON AND ON EVERYDAY, AS WE SPEAK, THEY GET RICHER, WE GET SICKER..</p>
