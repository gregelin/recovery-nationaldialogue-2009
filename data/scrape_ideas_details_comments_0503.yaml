<p>This is an outstanding product and the way it has been designed is great.&nbsp; I have never seen a system that is as user friendly as this one!&nbsp; All you have to do is answer the questions and the rest is fool proof.&nbsp; This should allow many entreprenuers like myself to easily address all the requirements for a business plan and funding quickly and painlessly.&nbsp; Congratulations to the inventors this is a great product especially for these economic times.</p>

<p>This is a great product because it's easy to complete, can be worked on in concert with your team -if you have one- and can be shared or networked online instantly with anyone wanting to take a look. I like that it's compliant and complete and includes due diligence items to save processing and closing costs.  
Such a platform can make the funding of small business more accessible, and provide a leg up for entrepreneurs not already well connected to funding sources. I'd say this is a must-have also for SBA as an insurer and all related processing and storage. Excellent concept and execution.</p>

<p>As a business development professional this could be <u>the</u>
product that can really help turn things around for us. It standardizes the
business plan and due diligence process for business financing and investment
and that in itself is a major accomplishment. The standardization and digital
format will allow for tremendous cost savings, for all parties involved,
because it allows for all sorts of computer applications, and associated search
capabilities, to be applied to the business financing and investment process
and significantly streamline it. The standardization also brings with it a greater
level of transparency that changes the due diligence process from one of high cost
investigation to one of low cost verification. Its standardization will further
streamline the process and shorten the funding time dramatically just by the
fact that the entrepreneur/ business will now present a complete package (presentation,
business plan, interactive financials, due diligence report and support documentation),
everything needed by any lender or investor to make a decision on funding their
application, the first time out. Because the application is web based, entrepreneurs/
businesses can now truly exploit the global business financing and investment capital
funding pool because now any financial institution or investor, anywhere on the
planet, can be given the opportunity to see and review a complete package for
funding. In fact, with computer/ Internet search capabilities, it will allow financial
institutions and investor to actively seek, screen and categorize business
ideas and funding requests from anywhere in the world. If nothing else, it is a
rock solid “disaster” risk management tool for any business and can
tremendously improve relief efforts when disaster do strike. With a properly
filled out copy safely stored on the web, when disaster strikes all you need to
do is get an Internet connection and you have everything you need to immediately
apply for business relief, financing or investment and the government can, with
just a few clicks of a mouse, easily designate different areas for relief and
other special funding. Just an all round excellent product, I think it would
definitely be worth looking into as part of the solution to our current
economic crisis. I think it is a win/ win situation for everyone involved that
can bring about tremendous cost savings, greater transparency, while, improving
funding rates for entrepreneurs/ businesses and opening the door for them to
the global financing &amp; investment pool; I’d say it’s the right product, at
the right time for our time!</p>

<p>I thought this was a brilliant product. Finally, someone's taken business funding out of the paper age and into the digital age. It should make it a lot more transparent to all involved as well as allow for some automated oversight of the entire funding process. It could be a great source for real time economic data that can be taken down to the neighorhood, since it is based on a digital platform. It should really speed up the process of getting funds to small business as a whole.</p>

<p>Because this is a standards-compliant approach, it contains the terminology (i.e., definitions, concept-maps/ERD/Process-Model/Ontology/Value-Chain taxonomy, thesaurus) for the "business-planning and reporting" functions to provide management controls over resources, within a broader organizational management life cycle&nbsp;.&nbsp; It therefore has a good semantics (i.e., structured meaning) base.</p>

<p>This idea is an actual system post-R&amp;D -&nbsp;ready to go.&nbsp; It does for business plans what the SEC forms does for the capital markets, provides a standardized plan and disclosure system for investors, and makes it faster to create a compliant and accurate&nbsp;report while also making it faster to navigate for any reviewer wishing to quickly find prioritized information critical to making an investment decision at any stage of the expedited due diligence process without compromising comprehensiveness and fine detail.&nbsp; Everything is done in vitual space in much less time with far more accurate results.&nbsp; This is a new era that calls for new solutions to age old problems that haven't quite caught up to be at par with our new technological capabilities. The Funding Roadmap is the epitome of this idea, and it is entirely a global perspective that benefits everyone everywhere on all sides of the equation.</p>

<p>This idea is valuable because it overthrows outdated methods of raising money for small business and start-ups, importantly, distributing necessary information via an online platform. The efficiencies possible with this platform will help more small businesses find funding, while funders will more easily be able to find suitable investments.  This is a valuable innovation in an area that desperately needs all the help it can get.</p>

<p>Looking further into this program, I can see how it is not only easy for an entrepreneur to complete, but also educational in showing an applicant the lay of the land, so to speak, in terms of compliance issues. A lot of people are developing their first start-up.  Also, the embedded video elevator pitch feature could give an applicant a real advantage if they are good communicators. Finally, it occurs to me that the platform lends itself to searches, and an enterprising applicant could find ways to drive interested traffic to consider his or her offering. The more I think about this idea, the better it feels.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Online cascading performance budgets and performance reports
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a new software solution now available that was
specifically designed to bring exactly this type of transparency and
accountability to federal agency spending, called CASCADE™ Performance Based
Budgeting Software.&nbsp; As the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.strategisys.com/software.html"><strong>online video demo</strong></a>
illustrates, CASCADE™ enables large government agencies to develop both
long-term strategic plans and annual performance budgets that show the measurable
goals, strategies, and budget costs on a program-by-program and
manager-by-manager basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With CASCADE™, program managers can also create separate goals
that relate just to Recovery Act funding and indicate that this spending is
distinct from their regular program budget amounts.&nbsp; For a federal agency with hundreds – even thousands – of
managers spread around the country, CASCADE™ can create a single, integrated,
online document with a hierarchical goal structure, showing cascading
performance budgets by program office and location all the way down through the
organization – with the responsible manager identified each step of the way.
And at each step, both the regular program goals, strategies, spending and
results, and the Recovery Act goals, strategies, spending and results, may be
shown for every organization and sub-unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that with this new software tool, an agency can
document how each element of Recovery Act spending achieves measurable results
that relate to existing program goals, a summary of the implementation
strategy, and who is responsible for guiding the effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CASCADE™ was designed by John Mercer, the “father of GPRA”
and is the result of a joint development project by Strategisys LLC
(Alexandria, VA) and Integrated Digital Systems, Inc. (Manassas, VA).&nbsp; The software includes many other useful
and unique features that strengthen performance planning, budgeting, management
and accountability in federal agencies, in addition to its ability to bring
performance-related transparency to Recovery Act spending.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information see <a href="http://www.strategisys.com/software.html">www.strategisys.com/software.html</a>
or send an inquiry to <a href="mailto:contact@strategisys.com">contact@strategisys.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>CASCADE™ provides exactly the type of operational
transparency and accountability that President Obama has called for, that
federal managers need, and that the American public deserves.</p>

<p>Yes, CASCADE can be set up so that fields in the various data entry forms (performance planning, budgeting, reporting) can be filled in automatically by pulling the data from an agency financial system or database (for example) where appropriate, while other fields are completed manually.</p>

<p>Regarding the opportunity to include text, I want to mention that CASCADE provides fields for written narrative -- such as brief summaries of strategies to achieve the goals and explanations of quarterly and annual results -- but it also provides a document management tool that allows the user to attach complete documents (for more complete details of plans and reports). &nbsp;These documents can be attached to whatever goal or set of goals they relate to, to provide the necessary background info.</p>

<p>There actually are federal managers who have expressed interest in what CASCADE does, and there is increasingly a realization within government agencies that it is more and more important to be able to justify budget requests by documenting clear linkage to plan goals and actual results. &nbsp;The challenge has been to enable that capability throughout a very large organization. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I spent 13 years working on Capitol Hill, both in the House and Senate, and I do share the concern that this type of transparency in spending and performance is not something that Congress has shown much interest in. &nbsp;That's&nbsp;unfortunate, but maybe now with the focus on making sure that Recovery Act spending is well-used, this may begin to change a bit.</p>

<p>One option is to create on the Recovery.gov site links for each department or agency to their cascaded plans and reports on their own sites. &nbsp;If an agency uses the software to create cascading performance budgets and performance reports, with separate identification of ARRA-related goals, spending and results, Recovery.gov could provide links to those documents. &nbsp;Another option is to have agency-generated performance reports also appear on Recovery.gov as a additional presentation.</p>

<p>As was mentioned earlier, because CASCADE is an open application product that can interface with any ODBC-compliant database, establishing linkages between an agency's manager-level performance budgets/reports and a Recovery.gov database should not be difficult.</p>

<p>Yes, this is just the kind of tool that would be helpful.&nbsp; It links performance, with planning, with budget.&nbsp; There are other vendors who also have created software that does this.&nbsp; Results Scorecard from Results management is another.&nbsp; This is what I expected Recovery.org to be.&nbsp; Whether they competitively bid this out, or use open-source developers to create it,&nbsp; this is the kind of thing that is intuitive,&nbsp;easy to grasp&nbsp;and quick to navigate.</p>

<p>To respond to both of the last two comments, we strongly believe that CASCADE helps President Obama do what he has said -- and begun to indicate by his actions -- that he wants to do. &nbsp;And that's in addition to how it supports Recovery Act transparency and accountability. &nbsp;Even before he was elected, he announced that he would set up a SWAT team at the White House and appoint a Chief Performance Officer "to improve results and outcomes for federal government programs while eliminating waste and inefficiency". &nbsp;He said that the "CPO will work with federal agencies to set tough performance targets and hold managers responsible for progress." &nbsp;And he said that he "will experiment with giving government managers the ability to work with their teams to establish goals and give bonuses when those goals are met. &nbsp;These steps will be guided by performance measures and will be transparent and visible to the public and Congress." &nbsp;Our online video demo shows how CASCADE specifically supports all of that.</p>

<p>Some key points from OMB's April 3 memo providing guidance to federal agencies on implementing the ARRA (Recovery Act) should also be noted, as they relate directly to what the CASCADE software enables. &nbsp;In stating what each program's Recovery Program Plan must include, the memo (p. 18) calls for a "description of the program's Recovery Act objectives and relationships with corresponding goals and objectives through ongoing agency programs/activities. &nbsp;Expected public benefits should demonstrate cost-effectiveness and be clearly stated in concise, clear and plain language targeted to an audience with no in-depth knowledge of the program. &nbsp;To the extent possible, Recovery Act goals should be expressed in the same terms as programs' goals in departmental Government Performance and Results Act strategic plans."</p>

<p>CASCADE specifically supports each of these requirements, by allow a program manager to create both regular program goals and separate recovery Act goals on the same planning template, so that the "marginal performance impact of Recovery Act investments" can be identified, using the same types of measures as found in the strategic plan (which the software also develops and then links to the performance budget goals). &nbsp;And the planning templates and performance reports also identifies by name, organization, and location the&nbsp;manager who is responsible for the effort. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I should also add that OMB's guidance memo (p. 38) specifically prohibits agencies from co-mingling Recovery Act and non-Recovery Act funds. &nbsp;One way CASCADE supports this separation is by showing for each program goal -- both &nbsp;"regular" goals and ARRA goals -- whether that goal's funding is from the regular budget or from ARRA funds. &nbsp;This distinction is also maintained in CASCADE's periodic performance and spending reports as provided by managers throughout the year.</p>

<p>Besides, the OMB guidance deals with a lot more than what CASCADE addresses. &nbsp;But because of how the software was designed, as explained previously, the documents it develops and generates can link to the databases and reports developed elsewhere to comply with many of those other requirements. &nbsp;It's a matter of being able to link a lot of very detailed figures to a specific performance metric or cost figure in a performance budget.</p>

<p>One way to think of the software is as providing the up-front performance context for a lot of other data on Recovery Act spending that has to be compiled elsewhere. &nbsp;It shows managers, citizens, Congress, etc. what that&nbsp;spending&nbsp;is all about, in understandable terms. &nbsp;Here's the goal, here's the strategy, here's the cost, here's what was achieved, here's what was spent -- and here's the location and here's who is responsible. &nbsp;Of course, it does the same thing for non-ARRA spending too.</p>

<p>It really depends on what the agencies and the Recovery.gov website want. &nbsp;Presumably, a federal agency would use CASCADE to develop a complete set of cascading performance budgets (actually one large budget made up of many "mini" PBs) -- as well as the related strategic plan -- going all the way down to the first-line supervisors. &nbsp;The agency itself would have access to this complete set. &nbsp;Then it might post online the cascading performance budgets (and strategic plan) just down to a certain level. &nbsp;However, the Recovery Board might call for more detail, or it might not. &nbsp;But remember, they will probably be tracking and showing this information on Recovery.gov at the individual project level anyway. &nbsp;OMB seems to want it very granular. &nbsp;It's a question of also relating that public information to the CASCADE format in a performance budget, and how much of that is shown online. &nbsp;Maybe even the local field office of the federal agency will show its performance budget, with ARRA-funded projects included. &nbsp;It depends on what the agency and OMB and the Recovery Board want to do.</p>

<p>The question about showing manager-specific information raises another issue. &nbsp;As the video demo shows, a manager creates a "section" of an agency-wide strategic plan by first getting a higher-level goal cascaded to him/her and then creating one or more supporting goals, with strategies, and then cascading that on to subordinate managers. &nbsp;But if a manager gets several different goals cascaded to him/her, then the supporting goals they create might appear in different places in the strategic plan (i.e., each under a different higher-level goal). &nbsp;This would be the same situation in a cascaded performance budget, which also shows costs. &nbsp;So setting aside the issue of how much of this is shown publicly online, it still raises the question of how to find out what a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;manager is responsible for in an entire strategic plan or performance budget. &nbsp;The CASCADE software makes this very easy to do, by including a feature called "Managerial Accountability Plans" -- which shows a list of all of the tool's users, and with one click on a user's name, brings together into one&nbsp;Managerial&nbsp;Accountability Plan all of the various strategic plan or performance budget sections (goals, strategies, costs, etc.) that apply just to that one manager. &nbsp;This includes both ARRA-related&nbsp;and non-ARRA-related information.</p>

<p>The software may not do that automatically in quite the
manner you describe, though it can flag where performance has fallen short of
the goal, which can then be the basis for generating reports the agency needs
by using a standard reporting tool like Crystal Reports.&nbsp; In CASCADE, both periodic (i.e.,
quarterly) and annual results compared with targets are entered, and then a
green-yellow-red indicator is set to show status.&nbsp; For example, for a particular goal coming within 10% of
target might be good enough for a yellow status, rather than red, while for
another goal the only choices may be just red or green.&nbsp; And in every case, there is a text
field for the manager to enter an explanation.&nbsp; In the case of a federal agency, the law (the Government
Performance and Results Act of 1993 – GPRA) requires an explanation wherever a
goal is not met.&nbsp; So the shortfall
and reason is flagged, but not automatically sent to anyone – the immediate
superior sees this information during the next budget development cycle –
although such a capability can be easily added as described.&nbsp; This is one reason CASCADE was
developed as an ODBC-compliant, open application product – is to enable it to link
to other existing tools and databases, such as one that can do what you describe. &nbsp;And obviously, we can work with any customer to make sure that the desired reports are generated from the CASCADE database, based on their particular needs.</p>

<p>Since this discussion is supposed to be about improving the Recovery.gov website, the best answer about whether to develop one large versus several smaller budgets may be that it depends on how an agency's use of CASCADE would interface with the databases and linkages on Recovery.gov. &nbsp;The idea would be go start on Recovery.gov and trace an ARRA item over to an agency performance budget, and then perhaps over to the strategic plan that is presumably the original of the long-term goals that should drive development of ARRA spending outcomes (i.e.,measurable goals for results). &nbsp;That is how the software being used by an agency can help put ARRA spending into a results-oriented context, and show that the results(planned and actual) do clearly support the strategic and annual goals of the agency.</p>

<p>With that thought about relating to the Recovery.gov website in mind, the agency also needs to consider that how it structures its strategic plan (as developed with CASCADE) will affect how it structures its performance budget(s). &nbsp;This is because in creating a performance budget, the software first asks whether you want that PB to be based on a particular strategic plan, or on a previous year's PB, or whether you want to develop a new PB from scratch. &nbsp;So if a department wants its bureaus to develop individual performance budgets, rather than cascading one down from the departmental goals, then it should probably have each bureau create a bureau-specific strategic plan first. &nbsp;But as mentioned above, if the Recovery.gov site is going to be linked to these plans and budgets, the agency may want to map those linkages first. &nbsp;So Recovery.gov has a role to play in planning this.</p>

<p>The Recovery.gov website will need links and not only to federal agency sites, but probably to those of other governments spending ARRA funds. &nbsp;CASCADE was designed to be usable by any large governmental organization, including state governments. &nbsp;There are actually two very similar versions, with one being specifically for federal agencies -- but the difference in the two is just in some of the embedded guidance. &nbsp;The video demo is relevant to any user. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sounds like a neat but it doesn't appear to solve the problem of multiple data sources and formats. The problem here is an integration problem that needs to be solved with a SOA, BPM, Data Analysis and Data Visualization solution.</p>

<p>Regarding the questions as to the cost effectiveness of CASCADE for a small government, it depends on how small the organization is and the expected number of users. &nbsp;While the software was designed with all of the challenges of doing this in a very large organization with many levels of hierarchy and goals, it begins to be useful at about the 50-user level. &nbsp;And frankly, the cost is quite low on a per-user basis even at that level. &nbsp;Send us a more specific inquiry about your needs, if you would like an estimate.</p>

<p>The drilldown is very interesting thought I wonder about the degree of granularity at the lowest levels versus mappings to high-level mission at the highest level - often things get lost in translation, however it would be useful to see how everything at the most granular level maps back to core missions and mandates.&nbsp; I did, however, not see any geospatial component to this solution - though virtually every use case demonstrated has a non-trivial component of "where" e.g. "reduce transportation incidents" "spills" "hospitalizations" and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is clear that these elements and efforts should be tracked on a geospatial basis as well, for a number of reasons - e.g. a certain metric in a rural area might not translate equivalently to a similar metric in an urban area, and so on.&nbsp; Similarly, urban versus rural drivers and business processes tend to have some differences which cannot be adequately understood through tabular approaches or similar means, but which become far more clear through geospatial visualization.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Tracking through Google Earth and web cam
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>An opportunity exists to expand Recovery.gov into a site that enables citizens to track recovery projects and how their money is being spent, and does so in an engaging way that encourages citizen participation, and hopefully rallies consumer confidence and enthusiasm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This idea involves posting ARRA stimulus projects on Google Earth so that people can sort and view projects by location, size or type.&nbsp; They could then ‘fly’ to the project location and see a graphic simulation of the project; read about the project (goals, costs, jobs created, timelines, org charts, project plans) and track progress visually through Earthcam or project specific web camera; meet the project manager and get updates; watch people working; find out if jobs are available; get links to job training programs etc.&nbsp; Scientific research projects could ‘fly’ people into a lab where the scientist would present his/her thesis, discuss the research and status of the research, and ultimately present the results.&nbsp; Clean energy projects could tour entrepreneurial companies engaged in solar, wind, clean coal, algae, electric cars – generating enthusiasm for what’s coming, and possibly even investment interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This vision obviously involves Google Earth, Recovery.gov, Earthcam or web camera network, and possibly the engagement of an army of citizen volunteers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementation would involve the addition of a line item in the communications segment of every project plan.&nbsp; The manager would submit basic project information related to location, costs, jobs, project plan, org chart for posting on the Google Earth ‘Recovery’ layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A working group would categorize projects as they are approved, and recommend how they should be presented.&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category A - important, high visibility projects such as infrastructure projects - light rail, highways and bridges, energy projects – smart grid and wind farms, and environmental restoration are longer term and lend themselves to graphic simulation, and on-site video and tracking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category B - large, high priority projects such as 21<sup>st</sup> century classrooms, and computerized health records are not solely geographic, and don’t lend themselves to weekly tracking but do lend themselves to visual example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category C - Big ideas for multiple small projects that create many jobs and should be implemented everywhere such as home weatherization, and Infrastructure repairs and upgrades, would show a generalized how to video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category D - Major Research and Development programs that lend themselves educational video, or tours of innovative, entrepreneurial companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category E - Equipment purchases that can be shown by photo record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category F - Training and jobs programs could be plotted locally, but also linked to like projects nationwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All projects would be posted on Google Earth in a special Recovery.gov layer and identified by&nbsp;&nbsp; placemarks – state or agency designated ARRA logo. Each site would be linked to the required contracts, invoices, payroll data etc. on their respective state, and agency sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain key projects could be assigned to a group of creative and technical professionals who would develop additional 3D SketchUps to simulate e.g. light rail routes, new bridges, green buildings.&nbsp; The group could even encourage submissions from job applicants as part of an ‘Apprenticeship’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Citizen volunteers could be engaged to conduct interviews with project managers, take videos, set up web cams, and monitor and promote interest in projects locally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Links existing technology programs and networks to turn Recovery.gov into a picture window through which citizens can view stimulus projects and monitor the expenditure and use of recovery funds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leverages technology to create jobs and volunteer opportunities, and catalyzes active citizenship and private public sector partnerships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creates a virtual 21<sup>st</sup> Century Classroom that uses technology and geography to expose and educate people about the ‘work’ of the nation, and links them to the resources they’ll need to participate.</p>

<p>I like this idea very much. Besides providing mor transparency to these projects for the public, simply requiring the project organizers/managers too prepare basic informaiton about the project and update it with the progress is a good excercise to instill a sense of project oversight and visitibility. I would expect having to actually put on paper/the web weekly reports should make the organizers/managers more</p>

<p>A virtual database of decisions, progress, and anticipated outcome would be of great benefit to the general public. A user friendly application such as Google Earth would have the resources available to make such important information available, with the tools necessary to understand the process taking place. Ideas such as this are instrumental in grasping such an enormous undertaking. Well done!</p>

<p>Interesting idea.&nbsp; You don't even necessarily need a webcam network to implement this idea.&nbsp; Just have stimulus recipients post a video to Youtube, tag it with recipient DUNS number and zip code, and link to it from Google Earth using those tags.</p>

<p>The visualization concept is fantanstic and almost unarguable.&nbsp; What I think is missing is 1) The process and due diligence that is required to&nbsp;assure projects are being reported truthfully and accurately and 2) The process that will take our current antiquated construction processes to the transparency and efficiency levels of the 21st Century.</p>

<p>I, also, love this idea, but think of the REAL COST! This would not be a freebie on the Gov.com.s tab or of anyone in the current adminstration's pay level as well. Google has been kind enough to give space for the Earth site without commericals, but they are a For-Profit Company as well they should be. Why should Google take on all the cost of such a project when the tax dollars just blew off billions of dollars to the car industery and, yet, here they are in Bankruptcy?</p>

<p>A project is well worth my tax dollars and one I would vote to pay for, but it will not help the lizards in Northern Caifornia get accross the street as was in the last stimilus bill passed, words unread by anyone.

SHAME I SAY (you all have me cussing in caps now, which by the way is not proper unless you are cussing) Be polite and pype correctly for best feedback please. Typos are alright, not all CAPS.

<p>This terrific idea might broaden participation from the general public. Most Administration services on the Internet have been visited or commented upon by only a few citizens.&nbsp; The usual Google Earth attachments of photos, videos and sound at each site might bring them in.</p>

<p>We have no comment from Google here! They would need to update each work site regularly. Currently, most Earth images are only updated years later. Are new satellite photos regularly available now, but simply not inserted? Might Google fund this project through their usual income sources? I would accept advertisement interruptions if they powered this project.</p>

<p>Many people seem to like the idea of visually mapping and tracking the projects
but doesn’t it all come down to the quality of information the project people submit.
How do you make sure these people are submitting good data?

<p>I’m glad you raised the issue of data quality and integrity.&nbsp; Its been raised often; it’s critical and it needs addressed.&nbsp; Our initial thinking was that this was a project management issue&nbsp;and that the state and agency boards would make sure project managers were complying with OMB’s published guidance on what information was required and how it was to be reported.&nbsp; This is a still a&nbsp;management issue, but as LMarkT suggests (referring to Rebuilding Management), state of the art project management software and well-defined attributes, could help PM’s report all the data, fully and accurately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Linked Open Data
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>This data must be put up using the current open standards,<br />as Linked Open Data.<br /><br />There is already a rapidly growing Linked Open Data cloud,<br />to which US recovery data will be a welcome addition.<br /><br />The priority should be on the provision of, as we say, "Raw Data Now!".<br /><br /></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>1. Linked Data allows different things in different datasets of all kinds to be connected.&nbsp; When you put data on the web, the added value you get is from the way it can be queried in combination with other data you might not even be aware of.</p>
<p>People will be connecting this data with scientific data, community data, social web data, enterprise data, and government data from other agencies and organization,<br />and other countries, to ask all kinds of interesting questions not asked before.<br />This data must be put up with an awareness that it is one among many data sources with which it will later be linked together.<br /><br />2. Linked data is decentralized.<br />Each agency can source its own data without a big cumbersome centralized system.<br />The data can be stitched together at the edges, more as one builds a quilt than the way one builds a nuclear power station.<br /><br />This stitching can be done as and when it is valuable.<br />Some of it may be an activity volunteer communities can help with.<br /><br />3. The Linked Open Data movement uses open royalty-free standards from W3C.<br />These do not bind the federal government to any specific supplier.<br /><br />4. There are many organizations an companies who will be motivated<br />by the presence of the data<br />to provide all kinds of human access to this data, for specific communities,<br />to answer specific questions, often in connection with other data<br />from different sites.&nbsp; They will in many ways provide more powerful tools<br />than the recovery web site itself can ever do using only its own data.<br /><br />This is a very important initiative. To have federal data available<br />online in open standards will be very valuable to all kinds of<br />people in the US and in fact world wide.<br />The recovery data is a great opportunity to set an example for future government data.<br /><br />A secondary priority for any agency, but also important,<br />is the human-readable presentation of the data to on the agency web site itself.<br />Note W3C has a wealth of guidelines in many aspects of reaching people through the Web, including accessibility, internationalization, and access from mobile devices.<br /><br />W3C has an eGovenment activity, a gathering of people<br />who have been discussing these issues.<br /><br />I would personally happy to help set this up on the right track.<br /><br />Tim Berners-Lee<br /><br />MIT<br />Director, W3C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w3.org<br /><br />Personal opinion not necessarily endorsed by MIT or W3C member companies.<br /><br /></p>

James,
<p> You ask about the technical feasibility of Linked Open Data being implemented across a very
complex nationwide system architecture&nbsp;within a&nbsp;relatively short
timeline.</p>

<p>I think the crucial thing is that technically it can be done bottom-up.&nbsp; Ideally you have a nationwide decision to go for linked data, but then if different places want to approach it differently they can.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may want to have some nationwide common terms, but don't hold anyone up for them.&nbsp; By September you don't have time to get nationwide consensus over new vocabulary.&nbsp; However, you may find that existing shared practices end up being leveraged.</p>

<p>To what extent is the recovery data going to be data which actually is already in existing systems, and to what extent is is data which really hasn't been in any system before at all?</p>

<p>Linked Open Data is much more open if delivered in open formats and standards that see WIDE implmentation and use. If Linked Open Data required conceptually difficult or esoteric styles of implementation (as is sometimes the case with RDF/OWL), it would be much less open than if it saw implementation with more widely used approaches.&nbsp; The same is true for the style of web-services deployed to implement this vision.

<p>I suppose that one could use standards other than RDF or OWL to achieve Linked Open Data, but (and this answers the database question too) there is one aspect of RDF that really must be adhered to - and that is the use of URIs for global identity.&nbsp; While it is possible to use global identifiers in XML and REST, unfortunately it has not been common practice, especially in government (see for example how the XML version of FTF makes reference to entities in the FEA; it is done by print name only, leading to dozens of ambiguities and seriously hindering the linked data value of the resources).&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is to clarify some issues that have been coming up in the discussion:<br /><br /><strong>Pro URIs</strong>. The genuine idea behind linked data is of course the usage of URIs for unambiguously naming things (concrete things such as people, institutions, books, but also abstract things such as feelings, etc.) on the Web.

<p>Jim &amp; BHAI: Yes, its highly feasible and and precisely the right approach for a complex nationwide system architecture. In fact, its the architecture for the entire web. Our government needs to match its architecture to the problem its trying to solve. National, state and local governments form a federation - as in the Federalist papers. The Web too is a Federation and following web design principles like LOD is the right match for this problem. In terms of time line, its a bottom up, or progressive enhancement approach, so its easy to plant the seeds with some well known vocabularies, then watch it grow. Government folks typically like to see roadmaps. Use cases are always good. And LOD fits with all that too.</p>

<p>Eric(s): There's no heavy lifting required here. XML parsers and XSLT do the trick. Just publish with some well know vocabularies and machine readable, structured data. Other folks who want to do more can do more. What we'll build is a not so plain web, circa 1998. We'll be part of today's web like the UK government has already done with the London Gazette.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some Advice to the Board on fraud and waste. Just like this dialogue, the principles of LOD empower citizens throughout America. We're all pretty familiar with crowdsourcing by now and organizations like the Sunlight Foundation serve as an effective catalyst for young, tech saavy citizens to watch their local governments and create web sites that expose fraud and waste. Frankly, I don't think you can effectively monitor the whole country from inside the beltway. You need their help and LOD's the right approach to empower those citizens.</p>

<p>Hi - I have drawn a first draft of a picture showing how the data available from grants / agencies (roughly modelled on Erik Wilde et al.'s very useful <a class="external-link" href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/ischool/2009-029/">proposal</a>) can be linked and combined with community contributions as represented using a combination of custom models and common ones like FOAF, SIOC, etc.</p>

<p>The picture just illustrates how the data within one (e.g. agency) site, that publishes grant information (in yellow) and allows citizen feedback (green), could be modelled and interlinked.&nbsp; I'm not an e-government specialist so some of my assumptions on the left hand side are probably incorrect, but it's just an idea of how stuff is related to a particular funding grant award.</p>

<p>Imagine how <strong>multiple </strong>grants, agencies, contractors, funding topics etc. could be linked together by expanding this and by using this common representation to link the data together.&nbsp; And it's not just across agencies that contractors or funding areas could be linked - as many of the concepts shown (with pink shadows) could be linked to external data for further background knowledge: company profiles, agency information, more data related to the location of particular grant recipients (for measuring impact, finding related projects, etc.) - from a variety of Linked Open Data sources.</p>

<p>Referring back to my previous post, this can be done by augmenting the HTML pages describing grants or allowing discussions with RDFa tags saying "this is a grant account", "this comment is referring to this grant", "this is a reply to this" or "this person said this" in a way that is reusable and can be linked to similar pieces of data on other pages or sites.</p>

<p>This is a good suggestion.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I agree that an solution must support common standards.&nbsp; I also think it must be open to every solution provider who wants to participate so one should avoid setting too much specific criteria that will might make it difficult for the best ideas to join the effort. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides being "open" one of the reasons Linked Open Data is so exciting is that the concept of Linked Data has formalized the use of HTTP URIs to identify entities in the "real world" in a coherent and useful way without introducing significant overhead. Oddly enough, the Web community has struggled to model this difference ever since Tim invented the Web. In too many cases, Web developers have been making infantile assertions like "my Web document works for my employer's Web document". It's time Web developers grew up and learned to speak "gooder". It's not that hard.</p>

<p>As "mlang" points out, data and the means of analyzing that data &nbsp;go together. &nbsp;Others talk about providing an application programming interface (API) to allow applications to be written against the data. &nbsp;I would add that it would be useful to provide the website user with access to analytical and statistical tools for examining and analyzing the data. &nbsp;API's are fine for those of us with programming skills, but there needs to be something for the user who knows what comparisons he/she would like to make with the data but lacks the programming skills. &nbsp;Perhaps a way of combining the use of API's and publicly available analytics would be for programmers to make there work publicly available through a peer-rated system for users of recovery.gov.</p>

<p>A second thought stimulated by BHAI's comment is that to monitor and control for fraud you need to define what you mean by "fraud." &nbsp;One kind of fraud is claiming to do work that you are not doing. Another kind is purposely overstating progress or understating cost. &nbsp;(I use the word "purposely" because estimating the amout of work involved in a task or the cost of doing that work is certainly subject to honest error.) &nbsp;If you are talking about making highway repairs, for example, fraud may mean taking money for repairs that you never do. &nbsp;In this case, you would need to require documentable evidence not only of money spent but of physical progress, such as miles repaved by a particular date. &nbsp;A way to check on the second kind of fraud--purposeful over- or under- estimates--is to &nbsp;compare paving repair costs throughout the U.S. allowing for differences in climate, weather and worker availability. &nbsp;You need to see if costs in a particular location are exceptionally high compared to the national, regional, or county average and to find out why.</p>

<p>I fully concur - the time for data to go go canonical (Raw Data Now) is long overdue. Triples (Subject, Predictate, Object)&nbsp; are the way that should happen. Why, triples are foundational in many data-intensive solutions - they should be the foundation for recovery.gov. The three key ideas that should be put into play are: "Every piece of data and relationship should have a URI",&nbsp; "RDF triples enables data to be aggregated, navigated, and actionable", "A small amount of OWL makes data interpretable leading to new insights".</p>

<p>Very similar to last point. Format designer usually has limited knowledge, and different countries has different national conditions. So please use a format that is extensible. RDF is one.

<p>Establishing Linked Open Data as a strategic goal for national information standards is critical. <br /><br />This particular forum is about information technology solutions, and so it is right to discuss the various merits and challenges of XML, RDF, OWL, etc. However, the end users don't care about technology - they care about information. There is a difference in meaning of "CIO" between someone who is a technologist (think hardware and code) vs. someone who is an information scientist or content creation professional (think librarians, archivists, journalists). A project of this size and visibility needs to address both management perspectives.&nbsp; We need to put as much effort, or perhaps MORE, into the user interaction/user interface models as the vast majority of the potential consuming audience will be neither a technologist nor an information professional. They will be the "knowledge workers" of the world, those who need to tap into the dataset when required for analysis, and won't care how it works, just that it does.&nbsp; [See jyurow's comment as well.]<br /><br />I am challenged every day in my work to balance technical resources with human needs. It is not practical to attempt a purely human driven system, nor is the quality of a purely machine driven system satisfactory. We manage over 20,000 sources of content on our platform; my team is constantly refining not only machine algorithms but also controlled vocabularies and organizational schema to manage the flow of data. It's vital for our own efficient operation, as well as the satisfaction of our customers to continue to improve both the transport of the data as well as the semantics of the data. <br /><br />There have been many interesting comments to Tim's post about HOW to achieve said goal; all of them have pros and cons.

<p>I want to second several comments that implementation and use of linked data needs to be simple and yet powerful. The MIT SIMILE project's <a class="external-link" href="http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit/">Exhibit</a> is a nice example. In a matter of minutes I've put together a Google spreadsheet, published it, and then used Exhibit to display map, timeline, and faceted browsing.

<p>Google spreadsheets (and perhaps Microsoft's online version too, I don't know) already provides a capability to publish data as a atom feed that will dynamically update any widget on any page as new data is entered.

<p>As the founder and project lead of Drupal -- the web content management system that recovery.gov is using -- I recently blogged about how hundreds of thousands of Drupal sites
contain vast amounts of structured data, but that structure has been
hidden deep in Drupal databases and never surfaced to the HTML level.
&nbsp;To counter this, the upcoming version of Drupal will emit structured
information through the addition of RDFa metadata for both common and
custom content types.<br />
<br />
For the recovery effort where government sites will have vast amounts
of structured data covering an enormous range of concepts and topics
from contractors and grants to Web 2.0-type interactions where citizens
declare their support for various initiatives, we could expose this
data in an open, reusable form that can be searched or leveraged by
organisations and individuals as they require.<br />
<br />
In my DrupalCon Boston keynote presentation last year, I laid down the
challenge that we need to put fields (i.e. functionality to create
custom content types) in Drupal core. &nbsp;These can then be associated
with rich, semantic metadata that Drupal could output in its XHTML as
RDFa. For example, say we have an HTML textfield that captures a
number, and that we assign it an RDF property of 'funding_amount'. Add
data about 'contractor', 'location', 'issue' (and/or any number of
others), and the possibilities become very exciting when this data can
be extracted and tracked across a number of government agency websites.</p>

<h1>
				Add Mapping and Geographic Analysis to Recovery.gov
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Mapping and Geographic Analysis capabilities would enable Recovery.gov to provide a “full picture” of stimulus spending as envisioned by American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maps supported by a Geographic Information System (GIS) would enable people to see, understand, evaluate, and give feedback on government decisions. They would show where ARRA spending is actually taking place and enable evaluation of intended outcomes of investments in local communities. This would require data about the location of investment spending as well as analysis capabilities that link stimulus funding to socio-economic and demographic data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery.gov should provide information and interpretive maps as well as underlying data and online tools for working with this data. &nbsp;The underlying GIS needs to be based on open standards (i.e., IT, Web and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards) to enable citizens and government to utilize the broadest possible geospatial analytic and mapping capabilities to track and understand ARRA stimulus spending and outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Specifically</strong>, we recommend the following to enhance transparency:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to select and view maps of the data provided by government agencies</strong>— This capability would be supported by an underlying Recovery.gov geographic information system, enabling the creation, storage, and maintenance of data, the database, and a library of maps showing basic ARRA fund distribution and status. These data would be directly supplied by government agencies.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to analyze performance spatially</strong>— The site should support an easy-to-use capability for geographic data analysis and visualization. Recovery.gov should be able to integrate, analyze, and display location-related information from various sources including Internet geospatial Web services encompassing spending information and performance measurement data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to create and share maps</strong>— This capability would allow citizens to easily and dynamically create maps of any recovery data at any scale: national, regional, local, neighborhoods, etc. This capability would support posting, discovery, and viewing of citizen-created maps. These maps should also support various types of analysis (i.e., time, project, and performance measurement). The site would support creation of standard maps by anyone using map templates. This would allow the same geographic data to be reviewed over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to contribute comments</strong>— This capability would enable citizens to submit comments, photos, and other information about projects (i.e., schedules, performance and benefits, problems, etc.) linked to the maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to summarize spending and other data by geographic areas</strong>— Citizens should be able to summarize projects and expenditure data by zip codes, counties, congressional districts, states, or other user-defined geographic areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable citizens to download data and project information</strong>— Recovery.gov should support the ability of citizens to download any dataset for specific geographic locations for use and analysis using their own analysis and mapping tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other recommendations:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable Recovery.gov administrators to perform integration and quality assurance of data from multiple sources</strong>— Recovery.gov will integrate an enormous amount of federal and state information. This information will need to be retrieved and brought together with systematic workflows that ensure quality as well as timely dissemination. We encourage the use of proven professional GIS technology and talent for the design and management of this system.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Require ARRA fund recipients to report specific geographic locations of all projects and expenditures</strong>— The government should specify that all reporting agencies provide x,y location data to support the Recovery.gov data model/format and enable geography-based analysis and mapping.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Employ phased implementation approach</strong>— We recommend a phased approach for implementation of GIS for Recovery.gov. This would involve a basic capability implemented in a few months with improvements after 6 months, and a full IT system deployment in 12-18 months.&nbsp; Early phases would involve integration and services whereas later phases would involve directly connecting with a distributed data and reporting system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the capabilities we recommend are already implemented on a number of state Web sites including</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State of Maryland <a class="external-link" href="http://www.mdimap.com/statestat/">StateStat</a></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State of Oregon <a class="external-link" href="http://www.oregon.gov/recovery/StimulusReporting/index.shtml">Tracking the Dollars</a></p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State of Washington <a class="external-link" href="http://www.recovery.wa.gov/map/default.asp#">Stimulus Reporting Map</a></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the other capabilities discussed here have been implemented in non-stimulus related applications by organizations across the country across the web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Maps communicate. Spatial analysis reveals insights and understanding. GIS provides the platform for both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve transparency and accountability you must be able to understand the raw data and analyze it in context with other relevant data. Using GIS to spatially enable, manage and analyze the stimulus data allows us to go beyond massive tables of data and simple dots on maps to begin to measure performance and evaluate accountability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make ARRA funds relevant to citizens you need to keep it local. To spatially analyze investment activities and their impact in the community and show it on a map requires a robust GIS foundation.</p>

<p>&nbsp; As noted in my similar suggestion, GIS already exists across many facets of government....&nbsp; by sharing the data at the Federal level, you allow citizens to view what is going on in their “backyard”, thus providing the transparency in government that this task is setting out to accomplish.</p>

<p>One other thought to add would be to provide the "dashboard" of sorts as to how the money\projects are split up based upon certain criteria.&nbsp; The strength of the analysis capabilities of GIS are where this could shine.</p>

<p>This is a very well thought out approach.&nbsp; The web site particularly needs to quickly provide information at the local level and use of maps is an excellent tool for this.&nbsp; I think searching to the zip code and quickly populating a map and back-up data regarding projects in a local area is something people will want to see.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a great idea.&nbsp; Visualizing and tracking investments using Internet-based maps is a powerful way to increase citizen transparency and government accountability.&nbsp; Use of GIS technology will provide analytical tools so multiple factors affecting investments and job creation can be seen and clearly understood.&nbsp; To take advantage of the power of visualization and spatial analysis requires reporting of accurate locations of the place of performance of projects and investments. &nbsp;&nbsp;OMB should clearly require recipient organizations to report the location of where Recovery funds are being spent.</p>

<p>ESRI makes some great points here, and their tools can offer some
great analytics and powerful GIS technologies. ESRI is already used by
many government agencies, and is a great tool for working with data,
but ESRI is very difficult for data consumption and for non-technical
users to use.</p>

<p>A second option which could be used in conjunction with the ESRI tools or as a stand alone application would be the <a href="../www.geocmmons.com">GeoCommons </a>
web-based visual intelligence tool by FortiusOne. This tool was built
from the ground up to be user friendly and easy to use. The entire
thing is web based, supports both GIS data formats, as well as
spreadsheet data. FortiusOne just recieved an FGDC grant for turning
tabular data into GIS data, which would open the system up for non-GIS
users, as well as allowing the more technically oriented ESRI users to
contribute their data in the same system. this allows multiple
disparate data sources to be loaded onto the same map, all through a
web interface that is easy to use by anyone.</p>

<p>Cheers and agreement with tbuckley and Billfgreer about the importance of effective map visualization and front-end tools for the public to use.&nbsp; Using maps to add transparency and information accessibility to Recovery.gov is quite a different design scope than front-end visualization and tools in apps designed for GIS professionals to use.&nbsp; A good&nbsp;app developer knows their audience.</p>

<p>As a US resident, I applaud our government's (and this new administration's) proactive drive to improve transparency, particularly in this&nbsp;program which&nbsp;has unprecedented depth and breadth.&nbsp; Personally, I expect and demand that this information be presented in the most consumable and understandable way possible.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I want more than just a slick web front end and dots telling me what went where and when. &nbsp; Sure, those who spend the funds need to report it, but&nbsp;taxpayers will&nbsp;want to know more than just what the tax spenders&nbsp;have to&nbsp;say.&nbsp;&nbsp; I expect more than just grabbing a few layers and databases from a few different&nbsp;public sources and mashing them together into a single map.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organizing, tracking and presenting the data by location makes sense for everyone.&nbsp; GIS, the digital system behind the maps we see on on the Internet today, provides a robust IT framework, organized by physical location, capable of storing the many rich media types needed to communicate powerfully with the public. It is easy for administrators to secure, understand and manage.&nbsp; It can scale to deliver a rich media experience to many,
many people of many, many different backgrounds, perhaps in different
languages, at once.&nbsp;&nbsp; GIS fits the key user requirements, the user being all of us -- it supports the delivery to all types of home, office, vehicle and mobile device locations of that rich, browser based, Web 2.0 experience to a public increasingly familiar with using the Web not only with their PCs, and HDTVs, but with mobile devices.&nbsp; The delivery of the recovery experience to America will need to encompass modes of media computing ranging from handheld to far-view models.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The issue with taking a GIS centric approach with recovery.gov is that GIS was never built to be democratized tot he public.&nbsp; GIS is built around the concept that trained professional operate tools to produce mapping and analysis that can then viewed by the public in a very currated way.&nbsp; How many training classes does ESRI and other GIS vendors offer to provide the traiing to operate their tools to create maps and data analysis?&nbsp;</p>

<p>GIS is a great way to provide context sensitive data to users. I would also anticipate users wanting a simplified interface that might provide a dashboard that combines a business intelligence layer with GIS. This would enhance the value of the GIS delivered information by providing additional analysis capability and could also simplify the user experience. There are some interesting joint implmentations of ESRI and IBM Cognos to support existing Federal and state programs. These should be explored .</p>

<p>The problem here is that you can't have your cake and eat too.&nbsp; So on one side GIS folks are saying that slippy maps with push pins don't cut it, because it is not GIS and does not have analysis.&nbsp; Then argue that it (anything with a map) is all GIS and you should use ESRI because it is the 800 lb gorilla.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The distinction is simple.&nbsp; If you need to be a trained professional to make the maps and operate the system it is traditional GIS.&nbsp; If you want to enable Joe public to participate, create maps, download data, provide feedback&nbsp; etc. it is not traditional GIS.&nbsp; Call it GeoWeb, neogeography, web mapping etc.&nbsp; No doubt there is convergence between the traditional GIS world and the GeoWeb but there is still a fundamental distinction between the role of the amateur and the professional.</p>

<p>Recovery.gov is all about engaging the amatuer a.k.a. the public.&nbsp; It is not about engaging the GIS professional.&nbsp; So if the GIS users in your agency like the web apps it is really irrelevant.&nbsp; This is about engaging the public and empowering them not GIS users.&nbsp; This is a fundamental distinction that needs to be driven home if transparent data and mapping in Recovery.gov are going to be a success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fact is that recovery.gov is looking to empower the public in order to achieve transparency. Some great technology (previously noted) has been created that challenges traditional GIS that must be considered. Most glaring problem: The learning curve for your traditional applications is steep, which must be accounted for when talking about usability for the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You are not going to develop something and hope that the basis public will look at it and say, "This looks cool, lets start using it."&nbsp; Generally, you create it and send it to your users to test, then you send it to someone totally unrelated to it to test it.&nbsp; When I talk about the GIS users in my agency most do not have any formal training they are basic beginning users.&nbsp; If these people do not accept the interface the average person on the public side will not accept the interface.&nbsp; So, they are a good test of what the the average citizen may experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The user interface is not going to be GIS - there seems to be some confusion here.&nbsp; But not to IT developers - perhaps 80% of any given project budget is directly or indirectly GUI related, rendering and exposing the functionality as robustly yet transparently as we can.&nbsp; GIS is simply the system behind the scenes, the framework, the enabler - the public will never see it, just like they don't see what goes into television or movie or theater or music production. We will all consume recovery.gov content as we will every other kind of content in the 21st Century - over the Net, starting with Web 2.0 (with users creating content as well as consuming it, communicating with one another, and focusing on communications over commerce), delivered to everything from a cell phone to a video wall.&nbsp; But all you'll need to know to use it is a web browser, and it will work exactly like every other heavily used, high volume website, e.g. what we used to call hits and hit shows.&nbsp; Irony noted.&nbsp; I've been waiting all my life to help turn GIS into a major production, one that entertains, informs, and educates the public.&nbsp; Many of us have been, and we are not only at ESRI, but at Google, and Microsoft, and Pitney Bowes; and many of us are in open source; and we are in conservation GIS, scientific GIS, engineering GIS, military GIS, business GIS, and so on.&nbsp; This experiment in alpha participatory democracy can do nothing but help, and give us all a chance to lend our expertise to our country and our world.</p>

<p>I would like to see an input/output model of the&nbsp;economy similar to the large&nbsp;poster Scientific American magazine used to publish annually--that was a matrix of the 1000 largest companies, arranged&nbsp;along X- and Y- axes, where the intersection of a row and a column contained a numerical value reflecting the effect of one company on another. It could include&nbsp;an&nbsp;analysis of the local effects, for example&nbsp;the number of jobs this might create in some community.&nbsp; I don't think those&nbsp;posters have&nbsp;been published&nbsp;for&nbsp;a couple of decades,&nbsp;but the model could be revisited for both public and private sector activity and extended by adding a geospatial component.&nbsp; In the application, the value of a cell in that spreadsheet would&nbsp;be distributed spatially across&nbsp;the locations of&nbsp;multiple locations (physical&nbsp;plants and facilities) associated with that single value.&nbsp;Developing such an application might&nbsp;be a daunting chore (perhaps a continuing governmental or NGO&nbsp;function, on the part of&nbsp;someone like the CBO or Brookings), but I think it is doable. This&nbsp;capability would be not just for purposes of disclosure and transparency, but should&nbsp;also be&nbsp;useful as a planning tool for local government and&nbsp;private-sector&nbsp;manufacturing and services. The application would be freely available to the general public.</p>

<p>Secondly, I applaud ESRI's suggestion as not only obvious, but logical.&nbsp; It implies&nbsp;the creation of a web-based mapping service, which will give all citizens the opportunity to navigate to a website and view this dynamic data at any opportunity, as well as the capability to drill-down to local-level geography from the national map.&nbsp; Most ArcIMS maps that I have used have been very easy to use, and can provide for HTML links, printable PDFs, and a myriad of other features to the public.&nbsp; I personally do not suggest employing Google Maps because it is not as customizable as a dedicated web mapping service, and&nbsp;I don't believe&nbsp;that the data should be decentralized outside of federal, state and local government &nbsp;(see <a href="http://recovery.ny.gov/">recovery.ny.gov</a> for an example).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lets not push "named" products but solutions, not pitch companies but resolutions. The opportunity for Recovery.Gov is simple - but challenging. If this was only about spending $800 billion and measuring 5 million new or retained jobs, then the entire option would be very simple. What seems to be the unique, one-in-a-lifetime opportunity is to take several tools, architect a never-before-created solution that brings data visual analytics, real-time customized GIS mapping, real-time econometrics-impact modeling, and at least ten years worth of historical and 5 years of projected trend records into one repository allowing different types of users to get the knowledge THEY want based on THEIR interests.</p>

<div class="MsoListParagraph">Consider the information products that will come out of Recovery.gov. These information products may include maps, charts, and tables targeted at different audiences (general public, analysts, policymakers, …).

</li><li>Since Recovery.gov will operate in a heterogeneous environment of systems and data models used in the organizations that provide the data, it will be key to not only define a structure of the information model, but also clearly define meaning of the elements. For example when asking to describe ‘the location of a project’ as an information item, how can one respond to that? By providing a description of the location (‘rural Utah’), a mile marker (for example for a road improvement project) the National Grid reference, or actual GPS coordinates of the project (point/line/polygon)? This is especially important when automating the process of receiving and harmonizing data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<li><em>Middleware operated by Recovery.gov that can be used to accept varying data inputs from source systems and normalizes the data into a data base</em>:
<ul><li>In terms of middleware it is important to realize that much of the information will come from enterprise resource planning systems and performance management systems in the various agencies that have the reporting obligation. These systems typically allow for exporting data in common formats such as eXtensible Markup Language (XML) or plain tab-delimited files. The idea is to extract information from the source system, transform it to a known information model and format, and load the result into a target system. This process is called ETL.</li><li>XML comes in many schemas that apply to a specific domain, several of which allow for the representation of geospatial information (GeoRSS, OGC GML, OGC KML, ...). However, these schemas do not necessarily capture the information needs of Recovery.gov. In parallel to the National Dialogue, feedback has been provided on the ARRA Section 1512 data elements to ensure geospatial information is considered when collecting information from recipients of ARRA funds.</li><li>Being able to read the formats is one aspect of the data flow, being able to understand the content of the data flow is as important. This relates closely to the information model discussion above. Many of the common databases allow for reading various file formats. We suggest looking at tools that provide an extensible mechanism for reading a variety of file formats, as well as the semantic mapping between the information models used in those formats.</li><li>ETL is used by federal agencies to manage National geospatial datasets as part of U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS)&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://nationalmap.gov/"><em>The National Map</em> program</a>, such as the National Hydrography Dataset, National Elevation Dataset, and more. Much experience with exchanging data across levels of government and transforming data into common data exchange formats and models has been gained from the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.epa.gov/cdx/">EPA CDX program</a>. There will be lessons learned from these two programs that would&nbsp;greatly benefit the Recovery.gov initiative.</li></ul>
</li><li><em>Application Programmable Interfaces (API) that can be operated by Recovery.gov to make all recovery data available to the public</em>:
<ul><li>While end users of the Recovery.gov site may simply want to get information without concern of technical aspects as API, for analysts, the API provide <em>the </em>mechanism to use the data available through Recovery.gov for their custom analyses and visualizations. At the moment there are a number of interface standards in use, such as REST and SOAP. Each of these interfaces have specific uses and pros/cons. REST is popular with web developers.&nbsp;SOAP is common in enterprise systems (such as those from which much of the reporting data may occur). Recovery.gov could implement both types of interfaces to facilitate multiple audiences.</li><li>As with the discussion above on information model versus file structure, the choice of the type of interface will need to be complemented with clear definitions of the capabilities of these interfaces. In the geospatial community these are driven by the Open Geospatial Consortium (<a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/"><u>http://www.opengeospatial.org/</u></a>) , while OASIS (<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/who/"><u>http://www.oasis-open.org/who/</u></a>) is a not-for-profit consortium that drives the development, convergence, and adoption of open standards for the wider information society.</li></ul>

<p>This is a good idea.&nbsp; It's important to have the capability&nbsp;to visualize the effects of the recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this information is available to average citizens via the web, who can drill-down the data to their locale or their particular areas of interests, it will create&nbsp;needed momentum and synergy.</p>

<p>To make the impacts of recovery dollars more meaningful and accessible to citizens, I suggest that a set of&nbsp;easy-to understand data measurements be tracked.&nbsp; For instance, track the following information by date and geographic location:&nbsp;number of foreclosures and bankruptcies;&nbsp;the number of crimes and their severity; sales tax income;&nbsp; home sales; layoffs; filings for unemployment benefits; new business startups; number of calls for help&nbsp;into mental health clinics, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The point here is to gather information on the human impacts of the recession, and to get a pulse on its progress through time by mapping it on a GIS system, juxtaposing it with a map of the recovery projects in that geographic area.&nbsp; One could also utilize approaches often found in gaming applications, to show the&nbsp;resulting positive or negative trends at the neighborhood level with graphic symbols of health (bustling traffic, trees/flowers) or stress (abandoned buildings, broken windows, litter/trash).&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is an excellent idea that would empower citizens to visualize the impact of the recovery plan in their community.&nbsp; Mapping, coupled with the underlying data, would give citizens the tools with which to measure whether departments and agencies are promoting local hiring as outlined in OMB Director Peter Orszag’s April 3, 2009, memorandum to departments and agencies.</p>

<p>There is no doubt in my mind that map based data presentation is the way to go.&nbsp; The least expensive approach may not provide the analytical tools needed to "boil down" the numbers into something that the average person can understand.&nbsp; Everyone wants to know and see the results of the stimulus on how it affects them.&nbsp; We need to provide the analysis that shows benefits to common people.&nbsp; The presentation of unemployment rates,&nbsp;job creation, home sales&nbsp;and the demand for durable goods as well as other&nbsp;economic&nbsp;indicators are paramount.&nbsp;&nbsp;The health of our&nbsp;investments and economic growth need to be presented simply and meaningfully.&nbsp; All data/information needs to be presented with the most cost effective geographic granularity as is practical.</p>

<p>The idea of geography toward tracking and informed decisionmaking is crucial. &nbsp;The concept presented here gives many potential functionalities and use cases, however it appears to be predicated on a notion of a centralized dashboard for doing so. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Toward building such a centralized dashboard, the backend feeds are crucial - these should be stood up at all agencies receiving and/or disbursing ARRA funds, and can be achieved through relatively simple means, such as GeoRSS, which is a conventional RSS format which includes embedded lat-long data, and are supported by a wide variety of both COTS and Open Source tools, clients and platforms. &nbsp;These GeoRSS feeds can then be aggregated at various levels, such as agency-wide, state-wide, or nationally for recovery.gov. &nbsp;Citizens and other stakeholders will be able to visualize and aggregate not only at a national level, but at the state and other levels as well and in fact could be components of a federated system residing with the individual agencies for their use and analysis, which in turn feeds into other systems, either thematically, geographically, or then ultimately aggregated in toto to such a central system as described by the ESRI proposal. &nbsp;</p>

				Provide Enterprise Resource Planning Solutions to Local Agencies

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Provide Enterprise Resource Planning Solutions as suggested by HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&amp;R) report on <a class="external-link" href="http://www.huduser.org/publications/manufhsg/ircs.html">Industrializing the Residential Construction Site</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Adopting the principles cited in HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&amp;R) report on <a class="external-link" href="http://www.huduser.org/publications/manufhsg/ircs.html"><u>Industrializing the Residential Construction Site</u></a>&nbsp;will&nbsp;empower local&nbsp;Community Development Corporations (CDCs) to quickly scale their operations with transparncy and accountability.&nbsp; A significant portion of the ARRA has been set aside for housing restoration and weatherization overwhelming local housing agencies. An open source, many-to-many, Web 2.0&nbsp;knowledge base provides a data sharing relationship between the CDCs across the country.</p>
<p>An innovative solution, <a class="external-link" href="http://www.rebuildingmanagement.com">RebuildingManagement.com</a>&nbsp;<br />originally developed to&nbsp;empower Long Term Recovery Organizations (LTROs) provide construction management services to displaced Hurricane Katrina homeowners is already in existence and ready to be deployed, . Nationwide deployment could be expedited through FEMA's Volunteer Agency Liason (VAL) force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious benefit of empowering local&nbsp;CDCs to&nbsp;meet the current need, long term distater recovery preparedness would simultaneously take place by pre-establishing LTROs for future emergency response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reporting to recovery.gov would be in real-time through RSS feeds.</p>

<p>The benefit of the Rebuilding Management Program is certainly an asset in disaster remediation areas such as those found along the Gulf Coast, but the real beauty of this ERP as it is applied to residential construction is the fact that it is 100% Internet-based allowing it to be deployed rapidly and with complete reporting transparency anywhere in the United States.&nbsp; <br /><br />The weatherization program will do so much more than just reduce our dependency on oil by reducing the costs associated with heating and cooling our homes.&nbsp; The program will create much needed jobs in an industry that has suffered greatly over the past two years.&nbsp;</p>

The weatherization program will do so much more than just reduce our dependency on oil by reducing the costs associated with heating and cooling our homes.&nbsp; The program will create much needed jobs in an industry that has suffered greatly over the past two years.&nbsp;
<p>The problem is how to best manage these weatherization jobs.&nbsp; It is my understanding that the Federal government has or intends to fund the states with the money to launch this nationwide weatherization program.&nbsp; The states apparently delegate to local communities who are not prepared to administer these jobs without risking mismanagement and deliberate fraud.&nbsp; So apparently the money just sits there and nothing gets done.&nbsp; Gridlock occurs because the CDCs or local units in charge of implementing the weatherization program are afraid to do so.</p>

<p>A&nbsp;ERP such as this could give these CDCs the important management tool to coordinate this work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know because I've checked their product out thoroughly and it is readily apparent that not only will the program provide complete transparency, it is also apparent that the management team behind this ERP is construction savvy.&nbsp; In other words, I came away with the impression these guys know what they are doing.&nbsp; But, I'm also biased.&nbsp; Let me explain.</p>

<p>I was approached by Rebuilding Management a couple of years ago to develop a business incubation program that would target the average trade contractor.&nbsp; The goal was to provide training, support and additional business managment tools that would not only keep these contractors honest, it would also keep them productive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My program, TradeCubate, does just that.&nbsp; We focus on educating the trade contractor on the best way to run a construction business and we use third party vendors that make sure things that normally get a business in trouble doesn't happen here.&nbsp; Correct payroll processing, paying payroll taxes, and obtaining business insurance are just some areas where the typical trade contractor is lax.&nbsp;HRM and HRMD are other areas that are important.&nbsp;Davis-Bacon compliance is just another area where our expertise can benefit the trade contractor and the local community.&nbsp; I will stop with the hype now and make my point.</p>

<p>If Recovery.gov is looking for an ERP program that is efficient, fraud proof and delivers 100% transparency AND is already coupled with a business incubation program that targets the construction industry and provides back office administration that is also transparent, Internet-based and offers real time reporting on the largest expense of any construction project (labor), then this is it.&nbsp; In baseball terms, this is a Grand Slam!</p>

<p>Transparency and accountability are the foundation of the Obama Administration and this looks to be the solution needed for monitoring the spending of the stimulus money recently set aside for the CDC's.</p>

<p>If you think about it, the world of construction has been plagued with three huge problems:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;The construction industry is&nbsp;mired in the same decades-old management, tracking, and reporting processes and doesn't&nbsp;seem to have an incentive to move out of them, 2) the industry is known for poor and slow communications of solutions, ideas, methods,&nbsp;new products, and problems (i.e.&nbsp;defective drywall) across the industry, and 3) there has been absolutely&nbsp;NO focus on restoring homes versus building new construction... all critical issues for the projects this administration is targetting.</p>

<p>Another, less obvious benefit for deploying communitee wide ERP solutions would be to the struggling US Auto industry.&nbsp; The aggregate work load forcasting would provide valuable equipment needs forcasting.&nbsp; These small growing&nbsp;businesses will need trucks, vans, insulation equipment as well as ladders and other small tools.</p>

<p>By empowering CDCs to provide construction management and oversight and using online direct deposit contractor payments, cash strapped small contractors may be able to avoid the need for an operating line of credit.&nbsp; This will relieve the pressure on banking system and allow stimulus dollars to flow directly to the workers.&nbsp; Manufacturers at all levels would be able to scale their inventories to meet actual market demand.</p>

<p>One of the first things I observed at this specific ERP was how well it addressed commonalities between business.&nbsp; For example, if any business no matter what industry, can break their process down into tasks, then this system is applicable.&nbsp; If any industry is concerned about where the money is being spent, then this ERP is applicable.&nbsp; In a typical ERP, the problems are usually found in taking realtime data and generating meaningful interpretations of that data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I can the owner of Rebuilding Management to chime in, I think he will recall that during our initial meetings, I suggested that he might consider repurposing his ERP to apply to other industries because at the time, I saw where his transparent model could make any industry more profitable and more productive.&nbsp; Just my two cents worth!</p>

Strategic partnering between TradeCubate and AMS Staff Leasing has brought in an industry leader into the fold to provide these services as part of the TradeCubate package(coupled with Rebuilding Management).&nbsp; Not only does TradeCubate offer a variety of ways to advise/train/instruct/etc the trade contractor, but brings responsibility and accountability to taking care of the employees.&nbsp; No more will an employee finish his or her work week only to find his employer skipped town with the paycheck.&nbsp; Staff Leasing will not allow it.&nbsp; Same is to be said for payroll reporting and the handling of worker's compensation claims.&nbsp; The employee comes first in the staff leasing model.&nbsp; Something that is often lacking in areas after a disaster.
<br />
<br />
The level of accountability in a Staff Leasing scenario is tremendous.&nbsp; When 100% of the payroll is visible and reported, that means one of the largest single portions of a construction project is visible, which has a tendency to keep everyone using the program honest.&nbsp; Honesty, again something often lacking in post-disaster areas.
<br />
<br />
The alliance between Rebuilding Management and TradeCubate is ideal.&nbsp; One complimenting the other.&nbsp; TradeCubate brings many facets of contractor management as well as incubation to the table, and by partnering with&nbsp;AMS Staff Leasing, completely handles the employees ranging from individuals on a work site, to entire contracting companies working on these projects.

<p>This is not the answer for managing the infrastructure needs of the country.

<p>RebuildingMangement.com will be very easy to deploy, with a very short learning curve.

<p>Its ready to go... its transparent...its in real time... it brings in&nbsp;the local community, yet has ability to be used nationwide.&nbsp; Of those mentioned, in my opinion, the prevention or discouragement of fraud is prehaps one of the most important.&nbsp; Big money is involved; we&nbsp;have to be mindful as to its use.&nbsp;&nbsp;The taxpayers deserve no less.&nbsp; This solution seems to address those concerns.</p>

<p>Perhaps RebuildingManagement LLC would like to release their software under the Affero GPL software license and reorient themselves towards supporting all the various government entities who would make use of such software. That way RM(who clearly wants to be part of the recovery effort) has a chance to make an impact and a dollar, while not locking the people into their solution.</p>

Weex,
<p>You have made an interesting suggestion.&nbsp; If the open accessability to the "code" held as much value as the disciplined process management knowledge base that the structured data&nbsp;offers, then your idea&nbsp;would have more merit. Opening the code up to software programers who are inexperienced in construction would be the equivalent of handing a power saw to a toddler to play with. A very dangerous combination indeed.</p>

<p>Interesting, a system that can track product, proformance of the job, cost by the consumer.&nbsp; Looks like 100% control. Government would probably not go for it, because there is no loopholes where they could create waste.&nbsp; One of the best systems I've seen, can't figure out why someone hasn't come up with such a simples solutions before.</p>

<p>RebuildingMgmt,<br /><br />You make several points that I'd like to respond to:<br />1. Programming code holds less value than the structured data.<br /><br />This attempt to minimize the impact of code on transparency and analysis is confusing to me. If anyone is to be working with the data, they will be using code to do so. That code must be available to examine so we can be sure it's displaying, without distortion, the data and any analysis that is required. No absolute value can be attributed to either the code or the data but with free software tools the value of the data will increase and without free software tools the value of the data if distorted or incorrectly processed may be diminished.<br /><br />2. Opening code to programmers who are inexperienced in construction is dangerous(like a toddler with power saw).<br /><br />The presumption that the programmers who would be attracted to this free software effort would not also be experienced in construction is probably incorrect but there is another aspect to this that I'd like to highlight. If you consider all the programmers in the world who know something about construction, right now only the ones who work for Rebuilding Management are able to contribute to the code, fix bugs, etc. In a free software effort all of those other construction-industry experienced coders would have a chance to contribute. At the very least they can audit the code but at the most, submit patches and improvements so the entire package improves. This process is ongoing in thousands of free software projects right now.<br /><br />3. Releasing the code would make it easier to manipulate the data and invite fraud.<br /><br />Having the code freely reviewable(which may or may not mean modifiable depending on permissions) means that running production code can be compared to the officially approved code release. Fraud, while impossible to eliminate completely, is much harder to do when all tools are freely examinable. In addition, using public data and free software any number of independent entities will be able to verify the results and conclusions of any other.<br /><br />4. My suggestion would serve to benefit hackers and consultants.<br /><br />My definition of hacker is different than yours. Hackers do not break into systems to do damage. That would be called more correctly a cracker, and a cracker would have a much harder time maintaining prolongued access to these systems if the code is free. Any cracking attempt or compromise, when discovered, would prompt an update of all installations of the software.

<p>In my opinion,&nbsp;a standardized data&nbsp;format such as what mikewillis has suggested is where the transparent accountability comes from. The ability to use data from&nbsp;an open database that would allow citizens to "mash it up" would serve the same purpose and with far better accountable results. If you have access to the data and your audit results&nbsp;differ from the reported results&nbsp;then&nbsp;an issue has been identified. 1+1 should = 2&nbsp;irrelevant of who's code is used.&nbsp; I would have much more confidence in third party data verification.</p>

<p>Actually, our definations are the same.&nbsp; I'm more concerned with the corrupt local agency using a hacker to help them circumvent established guidlines and ultimatly defraud the taxpayers.&nbsp; That's what goverment contracting consultants,&nbsp;tax cunsultants&nbsp;and 'insert industry name here' consultans do for a living, they identify weaknesses (loopholes) in&nbsp;a system or process and exploit them for profit.

<p>While a sincerly agree with the philosophy of open source code, it presents more problems than solutions at this time. All one needs to do is quick google search to find thousands of examples of housing program corrution cases that will under score my points.

<p>The most recent example that I can think of would be the mortgage backed securities industry and it's reliance on the bond rater's (consultants) expertise as well as the local mortgage broker's (consultant) role in the origination of data.</p>

<p>People like Rick Westmoreland have one goal, to put the residential construction industry back to work in a unique sort of way through the industrialization of an industry that has never been industrialized before.&nbsp; The ability to do so with cutting edge technology makes it even better and just when&nbsp;I thought many of the issues had been tabled, along comes a gentleman with an excellent idea; use of a GeoRSS feed.</p>

<h1>
				Open Data Will Enable Democratized Analysis and Accountability
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Focus on making the data available rather than the analysis.</p>
<p>In order to meet the goal of open data, the government should look to create data portals using technologies with wide market adoption, like XML-based web services. Web services such as SOAP and REST are self- documenting, quick, platform-independent, and currently allow for the most flexible access to the data in question.&nbsp; Third parties will make the most interesting use of the data. If a site like Recovery.org focuses on providing Open Data (timely, raw, and technologically neutral), it will leverage the passion and creativity of the populace to ensure real transparency and accountability.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>As a software architecture specialist with 15 years experience building information systems for large customers including federal agencies such as the Department of Treasury, OMB, the US Navy, the CIA and OPIC, I can assure you that that the biggest challenge with this exercise will not be the format or operating system, but rather the volume of data and complexity of providing it in real time without straining the underlying infrastructure or creating privacy risks.&nbsp; The identification, provision and documentation of query tables (revealing whatever data the government intends to share) is the most basic first step.</p>
<p>Speaking at a technology event in Northern Virginia, newly appointed National CIO Vivek Kundra agreed that open data is the key, saying he was "deeply committed to opening up data to make it machine readable and easier for people to use/mix/mash." The real creativity will come from passionate citizens and organizations that will follow specific aspects of government regulation, and government spending.&nbsp; Similar to other public private partnerships, citizens and organizations will combine government data with outside sources (mash-ups) to produce useful tools that enhance our lives. A quick review of projects that have already been created from simple data dumps show just how much creativity exists.&nbsp; For example, <a href="http://www.OpenRegs.com">www.OpenRegs.com</a> is a website that taps into data underpinning the Federal Register and allows individuals and organizations to have a real-time look at the regulations that will affect them.</p>
<p>The infinite manifestations of data suggest that the worst thing the government could do is to try and anticipate all potential uses of the data by attempting to implement some grand master system. As Kundra also said, "technology changes so fast that by the time one standard comes along, there's another, and another, which is why government can't lock-in on one standard.”&nbsp; There will be lag time between the release of the data and the availability of functional reports but it’s nothing compared the delays inherent in a monolithic and over debated central system. Never was the KISS Principle more relevant.</p>
<p>Start simple, make the data available. I think we’ll all be amazed at the results.</p>

<p>I agree with the principle that public accountability will provide much of the transparency intended by the law.&nbsp; There is still a need, however, to enable the OIGs and other government oversight bodies to perform the necessary governance of the government funds because otherwise we essentially allow watchdog groups and other organizations with potentially conflicting political agendas to provide the oversight.</p>

<p>This is a great summary of the information gathering challenges faced by all large organizations and is not unique to government.&nbsp; The ‘stakeholders’ are slightly different, and the issue is particularly unique for our government(s) in this environment because citizen’s expectations for access and transparency are increasing – and the trend appears to be accelerating.</p>

<p>To expand on the idea - the complexity of gathering data from so many different locations, attempting to aggregate it, and then display on recovery.gov is certainly daunting.&nbsp; However, attempting to create a master data dictionary, complex reporting requirements, or technology mandates is not a reasonable expectation considering we are talking about so many jurisdictions, with widely varying capabilities and technologies.</p>

<p>Recipients and participants in ARRA (and government into the future) should be encouraged to spend energy, time, and resources to manage data <strong>‘at the point of creation’</strong>, then make the data available.&nbsp; Systems and processes that facilitate first-rate workflow and capture details <em>when the data is created </em>will produce high-quality data that in turn can be organized and become useful information (to your point in ways that will amaze us).&nbsp; Although technology can (and should) help, this is not a technical problem, nor does anyone have a magic bullet.&nbsp; Its messy, hard work and our hands are going to get dirty.&nbsp; Too often the focus is on ‘organizing’ data and not enough time considering where the data came from. &nbsp;Garbage in, garbage out.</p>

<p>As technology-aware individuals, the challenge should be how to empower the average citizen to ask a question they perceive will provide relevant “information” and receive an answer that is highly correlated to that question.&nbsp; Lacking this functionality, in my mind, leaves us with a large national database that government or corporations can “interpret” for citizens but not truly put the power of data access and transparency in their hands.</p>

<p>I concur with the principal of this idea. But I disagree with the assumption that standards cannot resolve the inherent difficulties with data governance.&nbsp; The government can and should be the data standard steward of the public trust.&nbsp; It has done so in many examples in the past. Government driven standards have since evolved into many of the foundational technologies we take for granted today, such as the IP transport and Internet naming standards.&nbsp; The point is; the government picked a strong vendor neutral standard and adopted it consistently across government.<br /><br />Our challenge with any information centric standard will be the semantic definitions for all the requested data from the states and locals such that we are all speaking the language.&nbsp; What is the definition of a project? What is a job? What is the definition of on time for projects? Very quickly what appears simple is in fact semantically very difficult.<br /><br />Given the tight time lines for project reporting (October 15th) and the dire need for projects to begin and be reported upon, the government IT leadership needs to step up and pick a standard. One standard. Document it, educate us on the definitions and then let the community execute.<br /><br />There is no such thing as "lock in" to an open community based standard. Do not confuse <strong>standards</strong> with technology <strong>products</strong>. Without it we will have chaos, as the constituents will see the reports for what they are; a mass of meaningless and inaccurate data delivered to my iPhone. <br /><br /></p>

<p>Computers are great at translating from one standard to another so give the departments an initial choice.

If the data were using PostrgreSQL or MySQL the dumps from either of those datbases would preserve all that relational information and might be preferable to those of us with servers ready to store and process this info.</p>

<p>I would like to second the part about "that the biggest challenge with this exercise will not be the format or
operating system, but rather the volume of data and complexity of
providing it in real time without straining the underlying
infrastructure or creating privacy risks." But I would like to add that large-scale data sharing enabled and even ecouraged by the federal government will be hugely influenced by the implementation choice.</p>

<p>SOAP is hard to scale for truly large-scale scenarios, because the request semantics are hidden in each call. RESTful HTTP, on the other hand, has built-in scalability mechanisms, so that large-scale government data services could be implemented with out-of-the-box methods such as reverse proxies, sensible caching strategies, and good RESTful design of services. This really matters, and makes even more sense when looking at recovery.gov as a test-bed for the much bigger effort required for data.gov.</p>

<p>While any services provided by the federal goverment will have to use the same access control mechanisms as other Web services (API keys for limiting requests, for example), it would be a shame if the main problems were caused by the choice of technologies that do not scale well.</p>

<p>Maybe I don't get it; however, I would have thought that making the data available would be a basic requirement of the recovery. There are well tried and trusted methods for data exchange. We have to get past that and look at the information instead of the data. To do that we have to understand what is happening to the monies. -&nbsp;My 2 cents.</p>

<p>While this would be ideal, would it be faster to market for the government to just dump it somewhere for us to download? I wouldn't want to wait a year while these formats are specified.</p>

<p>A great example is the Hospital Compare database made available by HHS. HHS publishes a (IMHO) messy MS Access file along with the data updates once a quarter. It is by no means an ideal format, but it's a few short hours to parse it out into a usable CSV and reimport it into an RDBMS to do all kinds of cool things with it. Speaking to my prior point, Hospital Compare is the source of the data, and publishes it accurately and faithfully, but the myriad Web sites that do other interesting things with that data are just as useful, for example the ones that break it down to state-level data and contextualize it by adding in data HHS doesn't have.</p>

<p>I think this is the crux of the argument, and one I have seen actually attempted at state and federal levels more than once. Your point is well-made, and is an easy trap to fall into, however I think we should not over-react by removing this responsibility entirely from recovery.gov, but instead making sure the data is freely available to all of us who can use it to *add to* and not replace the analysis performed by the feds themselves.</p>

<p>For one thing, there is an army of people out there who want to read analysis on a dot gov site, not a dot com and maybe not even a dot org. My vote is for an over-debated analytic and presentation methodology *and* a free-for-all for the rest of us using freely-available data which over time can be served using solid standards.</p>

<p>I offer for consideration that open data, sans analysis, taken out of context can be worse than no data at all. The potential to draw erroneus conclusions from incorrect interpretations of raw data is high and once an invalid conclusion is drawn it can have devastating effects on the oppionion of the effectiveness or worthiness of an endeavor. I suggest that the federal agencies charged with the stewardship of these programs have an obligation to provide data with fair and honest analysis to ensure the non-agency evaluator has, at the minimum, a professional analysis at their disposal to compare against the raw data. The democratization of data does not automatically equate nor lend itself to the establishment of good policy (or the management thereof). To summarize my view, open or raw data requies context. Whether you offer up the raw source data or not, don't discard the analysis.</p>

<h1>
				Add National Online Mapping to Recovery.gov
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<strong>Add National Online Mapping to Recovery.gov</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advent of online data and mapping, provides Recovery.gov (and the federal government itself) with a unique opportunity to take advantage of platforms that are fast, efficient, cost effective and accessible. Just under a year ago, we launched a national data warehouse and mapping tool – <a class="external-link" href="http://www.policymap.com/">http://www.policymap.com/</a> – to provide users with online access to data, maps, tables and reports in a sophisticated yet easy to use web platform. Based on that experience, we have some thoughts and examples on what the Recovery.gov data and mapping application should provide to the public so that the result is not just a high-quality visual display of information, but an underlying searchable database of information for the government and the public. We’ve started to map stimulu transportation investments in most of the MidAtantic states on PolicyMap and hope to post a link to those later this week – in the meantime, check out some of our current work to see what we are talking about.</p>
<p>We would recommend that any platform used by Recovery.org to make stimulus investments transparent to the public possess, at a minimum, the following abilities:</p>
<p>1. Recovery.gov’s database and mapping platform should be a <strong>national online platform</strong>that allows users to see stimulus investments in a standardized way throughout the county. States have begun to create their own websites showcasing their investments (which is great), but they appear in different formats. Some have pdfs listing their investments, others have begun to create state maps showing investment dollars, and still others offer a series of tables showing investments by county. As these sites proliferate, it will become difficult to compare information across important planning geographies (like MSAs) or by type of investment. <strong>Creating a uniform format and then providing states and grantees with the ability to load their investment data directly into a single national platform</strong> will allow stimulus dollars investments to be both transparent to the public and easy to analyze across geographies and investment types.</p>
<p>2. Once loaded, individual stimulus investments should appear as clickable points or shapes in a fast, online map. The mapping component needs to be able to display the exact locations of investments (points or shapes) so that people can zoom into a neighborhood or city or MSA and see EXACTLY where the money is going. <strong>The mapping needs to show not just where the money went, but for what purpose, how much and to whom.</strong> And the location on the map should provide a link back to the agency that received the funds. <strong>The public needs an online interactive map to see where investments have been made in their city, neighborhood, block or next door. </strong>For an example , this link shows investments at the neighborhood levels on an interactive map. You can zoom, pan, and search for locations and click on any point to read the details of the investments.</p>
<ol></ol>
<a title="Investments at a neighborhood level" href="http://www.policymap.com//map?o=80150&amp;ofilters=&amp;cx=-75.23246613559377&amp;cy=39.9779166915507&amp;cz=13&amp;iwx=39.9754&amp;iwy=-75.2365&amp;iwtype=identify&amp;iwtab=0&amp;cx=-75.23246613559377&amp;cy=39.9779166915507&amp;cz=13" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i675.photobucket.com/albums/vv118/PolicyMap/IDBubble.jpg" alt="Investments at the neighborhood level" height="267" width="400" /></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The online mapping platform also needs to <strong>house information beyond just the locations of the stimulus investments.</strong> Federal dollars allocated to communities through the stimulus (or even other federal programs) should be a part of the platform and displayed thematically. Users should be able to simply <strong>mouse over any geography in the nation to see how much federal money they are getting.</strong> They should be able to overlay the stimulus site investments themselves to then see exactly where that money went within one integrated platform. For an example this link shows a map of Earned Income Tax Credit received by zip code in 2006.</p>
<a title="EITC by Zip Code" href="http://www.policymap.com//map?p=676150&amp;i=9586270&amp;btd=8&amp;period=2006&amp;ofilters=&amp;cx=-75.24831695636732&amp;cy=39.99192722412711&amp;cz=10&amp;iwx=39.97444464140758&amp;iwy=-75.26423195050432&amp;iwtype=identify&amp;iwtab=0&amp;cx=-75.24831695636732&amp;cy=39.99192722412711&amp;cz=10" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i675.photobucket.com/albums/vv118/PolicyMap/ExpandEITC.jpg" alt="EITC by zip code" height="253" width="400" /></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. When it comes to any conversation about <strong>investments in “place”, the need for accurate, relevant and timely information about neighborhoods, cities, metro areas, and states is essential</strong>. The government is a repository of great public data; information about unemployment from BLS, tax return data from t<strong>he IRS, population characteristics from the Census and many other statistics are regularly</strong> collected and freely available. By incorporating this type of information in the online platform, users can see on a map not just where dollars directed at creating new jobs have gone, but see what the unemployment rate is in that area; users can see not just where homes are receiving weatherization assistance, but what the average age of a home is in that area, etc. This capacity gives the Recovery.gov site the potential to become <strong>not just a place for the presentation of data, but as an underlying tool for evaluating the impact of investments.</strong> This map shows an investment at a specific place layered over the vacancy rate. Combining context data layers is necessary to diagnose need and measure the effect of recovery dollars.</p>

<p>5. The platform must be searchable by the public. While Recovery.gov will need to display a series of pre-drawn tables and graphs that help to visually display where stimulus dollars are being allocated, <strong>the underlying online database platform must be searchable by the public</strong>. As states and grantees upload their investments information into the single online platform, <strong>users should be able to quickly download a list of investments meeting any number of criteria so a whole range of questions can be answered on the fly.</strong> From “How many energy investments have been made as a part of the stimulus in my city compared to another city?” “How have stimulus dollars been allocated by congressional district?” “What are the education investments being made in my neighborhood being used for?” Making information accessible and making information usable are two different things. The stimulus investment reporting must allow citizens to interact with the data in useful ways to answer questions about their communities.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Recovery.gov needs to pursue a solution that provides the public with detailed information about the use of stimulus dollars in a single national web platform that can generate easy-to-understand visuals like maps and tables - &nbsp;as well as sophisticated reports and analysis.</p>
<p>Adoption of an online platform also provides the federal government with a unique opportunity to take this all a step further and create - in one, single place - a repository of cross-silo, public data that can be used to:</p>
<p>1) provide the public with free access to public data;</p>
<p>2) evaluate how communities are changing over time as a result of stimulus investments; and</p>
<p>3) open up GIS data for local communities as they consider where future investments make sense.</p>
<p>Online data and mapping capacities give the government an opportunity to do this quickly and cost-effectively.&nbsp; The tools have already been developed and are ready to use in applications like PolicyMap.com.</p>

<p>I agree that online mapping tied into other data sources is part of the essential suite of visualization methods required. Besides GIS mapping, I'd like to see relationship mapping (of contractors/agencies), systems mapping (all the environmental projects, say, and how they link into larger policy goals).

<p>Although your site displays an impressive amount of effort, I'd caution that the average citizen wants easy-to-use and easy-to-understand maps of programs and spending, and does not necessarily need to get lost in details or related economic data. Such layers are interesting for an economist, but for Recovery.gov, maps showing programs and spending, with links to explanations elsewhere on Recovery.gov would be best.</p>

<p>Agreed. We've loaded in over 4,000 variables from public sources (Census, IRS, FBI, Postal Service, BLS, HUD, etc.) as well as
variables that users send us - so the underlying database/platform is
extensive.&nbsp; One of our goals was to load as much public data as we could
get our hands on into one fast, national, web application.&nbsp; And, we really
wanted users to able to overlay address level points on top of thematic
neighborhood data.&nbsp; So, the capacity to do this kind of mapping on
recovery.gov is there.&nbsp; PolicyMap's users are public policy makers, state
and local governments, foundations, financial institutions and the like.&nbsp;
An application designed for the public would need a different user interface.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the geocommons map but if this is for the public good, I'd like to see such software provided under the AGPL free software license. That would mean that any user could download the source to the mapping/mashup software and set it up on their own server. Then they can download the same data from the government source repo. This will maximize the ability of each user to verify what they're looking at and the software they're using to make important policy decisions.</p>

I think this is a great visualization idea.
<p>However, I would be very reluctant to post street addresses of individual single family homes that have received assistance. This could make the homeowners subject to scammers (like the guys who show up and offer to replace that gnarly looking roof, then take off with all your money and the job half done). It also could place their jobs at risk (some employers are unwilling to keep employees who are "risky"), or cause family problems if a family chose not to divulge their money issues to other family members. Differentiating between individuals who need a certain level of privacy and municipal projects that require public scrutiny would be a good idea.</p>

<p>I think we could use other types of visual aids as well - bar charts, pie charts, all the standard ways of viewing data, but I really like a map on which you can zoom.&nbsp; I'd love to see such a thing combined with a "citizen reporting" interface that allows people on the ground in a given community to report local information about progress, perhaps with some kind of rating capability (progress = excellent, good, fair, poor; quality = excellent, good, fair, poor).</p>

<p>This is by far one of the best ideas put forth in this forum. I have seen firsthand the use of grants data overlayed with other relevant data that can help evaluate the effectiveness of a program. For example, overlaying crime statistics before a grant is issued and then looking at the same information categories after the grant has been executed can yield some very telling results.</p>

<p>One area of difficulty submitting agencies may have is the normalization of the data boundaries. Some of the typical geocoding that&nbsp;I have encountered for defining a grant's service delivery area can be expressed in a number of various ways (address, radius from center point, political boundary, Zip code, census tract,&nbsp; free-hand polygons expressed as lat/lon points) and the conversion from one input standard to a different display standard (for example input by Congressional District but displayed by State/Municipality) can skew the accuracy of the presentation. For example;&nbsp;if one area of interest was how many jobs created in a given area (Congressional District) but the collection data was oriented to a city that straddles two districts you can see results displayed wher none really exist.&nbsp;This is where the anticipated use of the data may drive how it is initialy collected and could ripple back to the grant application format and forward throught the grant perfromance measures collection methods.</p>

<p>So, this a suggestion&nbsp;I strongly agree with, but it requires carefull forethought so that minimum standards can be assigned that support the long term intended use of the technology.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Count ACTUAL jobs created or retained with CertiClear Job Counter
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><strong>CertiClear Job Counter</strong> [<a class="external-link" href="http://jobcounter.certiclear.com">http://jobcounter.certiclear.com]</a> is a “shovel ready,” job counting application that is easy-to-use, easy-to-integrate into existing software and inexpensive. Agencies subscribe to the hosted service with a low-cost fee and user license and no cost need be passed on to the prime or sub-recipients. If requested, the Software may be installed behind firewalls. Agencies have real time views of information and seamless reporting capabilities.<br /><br />The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends continuing “efforts to identify methodologies that can be used to determine jobs created and retained from projects funded by the Recovery Act.” [<a class="external-link" href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-580">http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-580</a>]<br /><br />Job Counter assures real people in real jobs are being counted accurately, preventing inaccurate “guesstimates” by recipients, or the use of “phantom” employees by fraudulent businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />CertiClear Job Counter is an IT solution that should be required by Recovery.gov and adopted by agencies to:<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide consistent data collection <br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reduce fraud, waste and abuse <br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide greater transparency as to actual jobs created and retained</p>
<p>CertiClear (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.certiclear.com/">http://www.certiclear.com/)</a> modified existing patent-pending technology to build Job Counter because&nbsp; government agencies have the same goals as taxpayers: to assure transparency and accountability and avoid fraud, waste and abuse of Recovery funds.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>According to an April 23rd letter from Vice President Biden to Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will be issuing updated guidance in early May to address concerns of state and local officials. One of those areas:<br /><em>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A standard procedure for recipients to calculate jobs created</em><br /><br />Job Counter provides the “standard procedure” by gathering the data elements identified in the OMB guidance document of April 3, 2009 (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/memoranda_fy2009/m09-15.pdf">M-09-10</a>).&nbsp; Recipients can begin today meeting all the Reporting Requirements (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.smartpdf.com/register/2009/Mar/31/14639A.pdf">Section 1512 of the Recovery Act</a>) of the Interim FAR Rules, which have data reporting requirements retroactive to March 31, 2009. Job Counter collects all of the required data elements through simple uploads or easy online forms, limiting the administrative burden on recipients.<br /><br />Job Counter will help reduce fraud, waste and abuse because it provides for a level of assurance that recipients are hiring real people. The jobs data collected is auditable information to assure validity, but not of a confidential nature. At no time is private information reported or confidentiality breached.<br /><br /></p>

<p>It is very important for the recipients of Recovery funding to report the real numbers of jobs created or retained.&nbsp; The public will not and should not accept "estimates."&nbsp; Certiclears Job Counter software is right on target because it counts real jobs and makes the results transparent.&nbsp; Thank you for the opportunity to comment.</p>

<p>My only concern here is that there WILL need to be some level of estimation of job creation in cases where the funding is designed to increase demand, which, in turn drives job creation. In the cases where recovery funds *can* be tied directly to job creation, this sounds like a great idea (whether it's this specific application or another mechanism I can't say -- I'm assuming we'll proceed with caution on any "use this tool" idea that was clearly submitted by the vendor; I'm not saying that makes it a bad idea -- just that it will need a rigorous evaluation to validate that it's the right tool).</p>

<p>IF the "direct jobs created" is tracked effectively, there should also be a second layer of estimated/indirect job creation -- as long as this is clearly presented as one number being concrete and directly trackable, and the other number being an estimate, I think the picture will be fairly clear (and it will set a lower bound for the actual jobs created by tallying up the "direct" jobs).</p>

<p>Accurate counting of jobs is crucial in measuring the efficacy of the Recovery Act and combatting fraud. The Job Counter software provides a transparent, straigthforward solution to help achieve those goals and should certainly be reviewed by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board.</p>

<p>Funding of the stimulus was based on jobs, therefore counting the jobs can also help funnel the investments into the right projects. Funding for projects should be released in phases. As each milestone is met, then the next phase of sponsorship can ensue.</p>

<p>As the CertiClear representative, I wanted to respond to a few of the comments raised.&nbsp; First, Job Counter captures the date of hire (DOH) of the employee and the AWARD DATE of the stimulus funds.&nbsp;&nbsp; A job is counted as "retained" when the DOH is prior to the award date and a job is "created" when the DOH is after the award date.&nbsp; One of the benefits of a SaaS system is we can modify it if OMB provides guidance that differs from our definition.&nbsp; We welcome other suggestions and comments about defining a job created or retained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, we realize the posting of our product is self-serving but it also goes to solve a huge unmet need of Recovery.gov and everyone out there attempting to understand and implement Section 1512 requirements.&nbsp; We have met with national, state and local officials who value Job Counter.&nbsp; In fact, it was recommended we submit our product to this site so other government agencies could learn about it.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because instead of spending&nbsp; millions of dollars on system modifications, a local agency can subscribe to Job Counter for a few hundred dollars a month.&nbsp; Let's be realistic.&nbsp; There is a good chance all the ideas submitted on the site will benefit a company in some way.&nbsp; We just felt it was better to be up-front about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Federal government spending from the top down through state appropriation bills&nbsp;is a highly inefficient process. It will be no different with this stimulus package. However, as a tax-paying American citizen I would feel better knowing that this money was saving jobs or creating good jobs to stabilize our economy.&nbsp;Seems to me that any systemic process that tracks jobs as a function of the stimulus dollars&nbsp;spent is&nbsp;a worthwhile endeavor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think it a capital idea (no pun intended)&nbsp;to count actual jobs retained or created vs. estimates. The logic however put forth as to how the retained and created jobs are counted is pretty simplistic. Actual job retention or creation is far more complex than the comparison of&nbsp; Date Of Hire (DOH)&nbsp;and award date as below.</p>

<p>How does job counter account for a saved job.&nbsp; This sounds like an model to estimate job creation. It is important to account for actual job created and not fallback to an estimation model. Contractors should be asked to report on actual jobs created.</p>

<p>If the federal agencies are not using this tool, what alternative are they using to measure this important metric?&nbsp; Estimates (guesses)???&nbsp;&nbsp; I would think that insufficient reporting and oversight would make these contracts ripe for fraud and perhaps that is a secondary value of this tool.

<p>Job creation is a major goal of the Recovery Act so a reliable and&nbsp;efficient way of counting jobs created and retained is critical. CertiClear proposes a manner of collecting data on the actual number of jobs created and retained. Furthermore, it tracks how the count is reported up through the various levels of reporting, thereby&nbsp;ensuring reliability. This seems like an excellent method of tracking job creation and retention.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fcserafica</p>

<h1>
				Citability.org - Making Govt documentation web citable to a paragraph level
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<div id="wikipage" class="box wikistyle">
<div id="wikipage-inner">
<p>WHAT</p>
<p>Asking Government to create advanced permalinks on a paragraph level to all public government documents and websites</p>
<br />
<p>HOW</p>
<p>It is pretty simple, actually.</p>
<p>A human readable URL that includes:</p>
<p>Domain Name / (path is necessary) /Document Name /&nbsp; DateTime stamp / and a heirarchical path to the paragraph</p>
<p>You can add a Path to document if needed to be unique but must be human readable.</p>
<p>The Hierarchical path should degrade nicely to point to larger and
larger portions of the document (like an entire paragraph or chapter.)</p>
<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://citability.pbworks.com/CopyofHR1586IH">Http://senate.gov/HR1586IH/03182009-2330/<strong>HR1586S1b1Bii</strong></a></p>
<p>which would point to this clause</p>
<p>" $250,000 ($125,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return)."</p>
<p>in the March 18, 2009 version of the Bill HR 1586</p>
<p>Section 1, subsection b, chapter 1, paragraph B, clause ii</p>
<p>WHEN</p>
<p>We are recruiting different levels of government implementation one agency at a time.&nbsp; Recovery.gov's support on <a href="http://citability.org/">http://citability.org</a> will illustrate the demand and be a brave sign of leadership.</p>
<p>We are asking various propertary software vendors to implement this standard in their software products.</p>
<p>WHERE</p>
<p><a href="http://citability.org/">Http://citability.org</a> - where we rally support for the concept</p>
<p><a href="http://citability.pbwiki.com/">http://citability.pbworks.com</a>
- to help promote feedback on the internal standards we are
suggesting. And inspire participation in creating various implementations in different
software to backups and server failover settings.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>WHY</p>
<p>To make Government more accessible to the average citizen.</p>
<p>To make it easy to create citations on blogs and sites like wikipedia that do not break over time.</p>
<p>To make issues easily searchable with a unique identifier.</p>
<p>So that we can aggregate pro and con responses on an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, many government documents are provided only in PDF
format, which makes it impossible to link to a specific page or
paragraph.</p>
<p>Recovery.gov could be a shining example to all governments worldwide!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery.gov is done in Drupal.&nbsp; All websites that are done in CMS's
generate "pretty" urls.&nbsp; We would take advantage of that to create
these "beautiful" URLs.&nbsp; Our Drupal experts tells us the cost is
insignificant (&gt;50k) and it would help many nongovernmental websites
as well to become web citable because Drupal is Open Source and all
updates can be shared!</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://citability.pbworks.com/Drupal">http://citability.pbworks.com/Drupal</a> to see our notes on a Drupal implementation for this concept.</p>
<p>We also have a QuickFix solution too that would be even LESS! <a class="external-link" href="http://citability.pbworks.com/QuickFix">http://citability.pbworks.com/QuickFix</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This should be done for legislation as well for recovery documents (and other gov't data). It may be expensive to implement in some gov't contexts, so those costs should be taken into account prior to implementation. In general, however,&nbsp; allowing the public to do detailed citations via hyperlinks should be a greater consideration for gov't technologists.</p>

<p>Using citations that are URLs is vitally important to discussing legislation and I commend Citability for bringing this up. Having permanent links to legislation has been a goal of the Library of Congress. They have issued permalinks to the Thomas bill status page for a bill (see <a class="external-link" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/handles/help.html">http://thomas.loc.gov/home/handles/help.html</a> ) that can already be used as an electronic citation. But they have not issued links to each of the versions of the bills, because they have not established a standard for the bills (right now, only some versions are in XML, all are in text and PDF, and at temporary links, there is HTML. Nor is there a standard for linking to a portion of a bill or law, which Citability correctly points out is vital in the context of 400+ page laws, like the Recovery Act.</p>

<p>My preference that would meet the goal of providing electronic citations that reach down to the paragraphs (or more), is to use an XML version similar to the one that is being used currently by the House of Representatives (XML Schema and data dictionary can be found at <a class="external-link" href="http://xml.house.gov/">XML.house.gov</a>). And like the current XML version, it would appear as HTML in web browsers using XSL. The legislation and laws could then be referenced to any portion of the legislation down to the paragraph using anchor links. In addition there is a standard for XHTML/XML documents called XPointer that would allow for even more fine grained citations or alternate citation schemes using the same document.</p>

<p>Unlike the standard espoused by Citability, which is similar to the current UK standard, there is no server processor overhead beyond just having a static document at one URL instead of split over hundreds or thousands of URIs. And since the sections of the bill are not as clear as might be assumed, if there was an error in the anchor or XPointer, the URL would still resolve to the bill or law document.&nbsp;</p>

And since the sections of the bill are not as clear as might be assumed, if there was an error in the anchor or XPointer, the URL would still resolve to the bill or law document.&nbsp;
<p>I am hopeful that the Library of Congress, GPO and the National Archives among others will move to this form of simple, lightweight standardization. Perhaps in the interim, Recovery.gov could provide a valid XHTML version perhaps using XSLT just for the Recovery Act. Please do not depend on Javascript for creating or resolving links. These URLs could then be used to reference each portion of the law from within web sites across the Internet and easily searched or aggregated definitively (see <a class="external-link" href="http://opendialogcoalition.org/">OPIA</a>).</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Accurate and reliable reporting of&nbsp;agency's data sets is critical in gaining public trust of the&nbsp;government initiatives and&nbsp;results. Disperate data also require adherence to uniform data standards to enable data analysis and decision making.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Data quality and data standards are fundamental to decision making. Having hundreds (if not thousands) of data sources based on a variety of data standards make the analysis and decisions based on such "bad" data unsound.</p>

<p>Quality data standards and quality data are essential, as is leadership to create the systems to create the standards and enforce quality control. XBRL was a stunning success in private finance (and has been implemented globally and for other business information besides financial information).

<p>I think this is true when you are talking about big "D" data, or quantitative performance measure kinds of data.&nbsp;But, it can take a long time to reach agreement on the definitions and data standards.&nbsp; Given the potentially thousands of&nbsp;"players" in these projects, it may be easiest for the Feds to send out clearly defined measures and data standards.&nbsp; As a state representative, though, I must say that it usually works best if the states, state partners&nbsp;and Federal Government partner on the definitions.&nbsp; The states live the reality a little closer to the ground and often provide useful modifications and insights.&nbsp; It can take up to a year to modify state data systems to capture new information.</p>

<p>That's why leadership is vital. The way agreement on the U.S. GAAP tags was reached so quickly was that the right experts were compelled to work together on a tight deadline to come up with a draft; the draft was exposed to a highly efficient and robust public comment process using cutting edge Wiki-style software (created by a company Warren Buffett funds called Core Filing); and the final arbiters had authority to make tough calls, knowing that the X in XBRL stands for eXtensible, which makes up for any mistakes until the taxonomy can be revised (which can also be done quickly, with the right leadership). In fact, had the federal government itself tried to do the work using standard operating procedures, the project probably would have ended up like a large plurality of government software projects -- in failure.</p>

<p>Another advantage of XBRL is that software doesn't need to be updated to handle new data tags and new data -- all that must be done to deal with an updated taxonomy is to tell the software where on the Internet it can find the updated taxonomy. More than 8,000 smaller U.S. banks and tens of thousands of smaller entities around the world are using XBRL software successfully. State and local governments should enjoy the same cost savings and productivity improvements it's giving these other organizations.</p>

<p>Data standards for the Recovery.gov should be easy to implement across multiple levels of government.&nbsp; As a simplier method for ensuring interoperability of information to meet the transparency goals, a simple schema based standard such as the National Information Exchange Model might better fit the City, County, State and Tribal requirements.&nbsp; XBRL is a pretty complex standard&nbsp;for these&nbsp;local IT environments.&nbsp; IT Budgets in the Banking industry are very different than those compared at the local government level.</p>

<p>Yes, the standards must be easy to implement. David Stephenson's idea to use XBRL at <a href="../web-based-reporting-process-similar-to-turbotax">http://www.thenationaldialogue.org/ideas/web-based-reporting-process-similar-to-turbotax</a>&nbsp;is excellent. In fact, using XBRL should be&nbsp;even easier for end users than using TurboTax, since there isn't a century of tax law with which to deal. A major reason to use any XML-based standard is that will be less expensive for end users than current systems.</p>

<p>XBRL is rather simple once you get past the&nbsp;experts charging to translate the jargon (and with so many XML experts,&nbsp;even overpaying for XBRL expertise is&nbsp;much cheaper and much more transparent than buying proprietary systems). Even so, in the banking sector,&nbsp;small banks -- including mom &amp; pop-type operations -- find XBRL cost effective because they don't need to understand XBRL technology. The software hides&nbsp;the scary looking symbols. (Any town getting federal money should at least have a bookkeeper approximately as competent as the one inputting data at the small bank next door to city hall.)</p>

<p>Independent governance of reporting standards is also important. NIEM is interesting. On its web site, <a href="http://www.ijis.org/">http://www.ijis.org/</a>, it says it "is a nonprofit membership organization funded primarily through grants from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Our members are information technology companies and consultancies that provide products or services to the justice, public safety, and homeland security sectors for the purpose of helping these communities share information."</p>

<p>It's worth considering whether taxpayer money should&nbsp;control a disclosure standard developed by vendors subsidized with&nbsp;taxpayer money. An advantage of XBRL is that it is a global standard with a well-developed independent governance model (see <a href="http://xbrl.org/">http://xbrl.org/</a>). XBRL International has&nbsp;operated much longer than NIEM, there's extensive off-the-shelf knowledge and software to handle the XBRL standard, and it's been proven in multiple other national reporting projects.</p>

<p>droy raises some concerns about XBRL in terms it's complexity of implementation. There are examples of XBRL production systems that use Excel, simple forms or embeded XBRL capabilities in existing software packages. All these systems are simple-to-use from the end user / citizen's perspective.</p>

<p>I support pjwilk's last comment that it would be an fruitful exercise to see look at the "mash up" of XBRL and NIEM - there may be real value in exploring implementing NIEM using XBRL.</p>

<p>Despite the effort, a taxonomy must be created that allows for data to be compared precisely across multiple fields (geospace, professions, demographics, vendors, etc.) -- but the system must be fluid enough that users may manipulate the data sets to specific purposes. As the United States has developed good standard for data comparison since at least WWII there exists a reasonable baseline. The other advantage is that the funds have a reasonably stable source of origin. Based on this history and source a stable 0 point can be established, which can always be referenced to, while a far more useful baseline taxonomy can be evolved. This evolving data taxonomy will better reflect the type of Gov't spending scales we are now entering; the taxonomy must be nesting so users of all levels of expertise can drill down rapidly to pinpoint their areas of interest. If this is done properly voters will be able to understand the scope of cost/benefit. Another area where such a clear taxonomy would benefit would be in understanding debt "investment" vs. direct unrecoverable (i.e., future tax requirement) expenditure.</p>

<p>There is a cost/benefit analysis of implementation of XBRL for U.S. GAAP starting on page 6802 of the Federal Register at&nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span"><a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2009/33-9002fr.pdf">http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2009/33-9002fr.pdf</a>. As you can see, the professional staff of the SEC did not find that XBRL for U.S. GAAP would be particularly cumbersome or costly. The SEC staff also examined much simpler reporting schemes for mutual funds and credit rating agencies and reached similar conclusions. I hope the recovery.gov designers use the considerable expertise on this topic developed in the SEC's Office of Economic Analysis to inform their choices.</span></p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span">You are, of course, correct that government and commercial entities are different. In this case, a main difference would be that the data to be reported from governments would be much less complex than data reported under U.S. GAAP.

I suspect the government data would also be simpler than the relatively simple mutual fund and credit rating agency information collected by the SEC or the Call Report data collected by the FDIC (from many banks smaller than even very local government units).</span></p>

<p>I think it is incorrect to suggest that open source systems will save money.&nbsp;Many government customers today own prodcuts they can leverage, without bringing new open source requirements into their architecture.&nbsp; More importantly, government customers&nbsp;&nbsp;should be looking at their enterprise architectures and understanding how to&nbsp;simplify the environment to reduce costs and improve security.</p>

<p>The problem with proprietary software is you become immediately locked in to one vendor’s application. If you want to modify, create or extend the software what are you going to do? Open Source is complete flexibility.</p>

<p>I am an open source advocate but it is also true that there are many existing applications that will already do much of what is required. If the goal is economic recovery we shouldn't be eliminating competition. However, the data should be open-sourced and in a commonly used format. That way we can build our own applications on top of it...since the application interface tends to flatter the point-of-view of the interface's owner we will get a more accurate(?) picture by crowdsourcing it.</p>

<p>Open Source is *not* about saving money....its about freedom, not "free stuff". It is about the freedom to explore the code, to adapt it to your needs, to learn from it. All of which are very good reasons to use open source.</p>

<p>In the context of the recovery.gov mission, it is far more important to focus on open standards, which is not the same as open source. With open standards, different companies, big or small can provide interoperable solutions by creating a well defined layer of abstraction, or services layer. This way, everyone benefits - remember economic recovery is about creating jobs, investing in people, so they can turn around an buy goods and services. Companies of all sizes are made of people, good, hard working people, with families and financial responsibilities. Those companies are the same companies that contribute to the open source community to foster the innovation and freedom of exploration. Your examples of open source underscore this: BIRT, eclipse, etc are all supported and/or contributed by companies.</p>

<p>Also the first word of your idea troubles me: build. If you watch the intro video on this website, it was clear that the government is looking for solutions with low customization and low cost. Building something is high cost, high customization..its the classic build vs. buy decision.</p>

<p>I would recommend that everyone take a hard look at what is at stake here. The recovery.gov infrastructure should leverage open standards to foster interoperability. The best solutions for the government should abide by these open standards, and if some components are open source, than that is great, however the government should not limit themselves to *only* considering OSS to meet these critical challenges...there is a win-win solution here with open standards for business and government to realize the mission of economic recovery.</p>

<p>in the spirit of being technologically bipartisan let's nopt make this a technology religion war. Open source has alot to offer, but why hope for volunteer support, or pay for the&nbsp;formal support and have to manage the complicated integration necessary with multiple opensource components, not to mention the "it's not my products fault"&nbsp;issue&nbsp;when the Government already owns a fully integrated, mature enterprise&nbsp;solution set?

<p>Open Source as a means for saving money is moot at the enterprise level. The reason Open Source technologies, formats and standards are better for government is simply that open code means accountability, transparency and accessibility. The very same attributes I require of my government I also require of the information the government makes public. While I would prefer the government rely more heavily on enterprise open source within the agencies, I am much more interested in open document formats (I do not own Microsoft Office for example), open descriptions of the methodologies used to analyse the data, open publishing technologies that allow me to remove and manipulate the data. Open source breeds open ideas breeds open accountability. It's not the answer, but it's a great tool, especially when employed in the public domain. You want interoperable health information technology? Go open source. We talk to each other out of the box.</p>

<h1>
				Central Knowledge Foundation for Transparency, Collaboration, Immediacy 
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<strong>
</strong><p class="MsoPlainText">Constituents want transparency and information from the government, but knowledge is scattered across numerous systems<span class="A5">, </span>difficult to search<span class="A5">, and </span>quickly becomes out of-date.&nbsp; Agencies, can overcome these obstacles by implementing an effective <a href="http://www.rightnow.com/crm-suite-knowledge-management.php"><u>knowledge foundation</u></a>. A powerful, patented, self-learning knowledge foundation ensures that both constituents and agency staff have ready access to information that’s accurate, up-to-date, and relevant across multiple channels —phone, web, email, or live chat.&nbsp; Knowledge management also helps agencies monitor constituent feedback, disseminate consistent information, and easily update content.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">The <a href="http://www.rightnow.com/customers-us-epa-office-of-environmental-information.php"><u>Environmental Protection Agency</u></a>, <a href="http://www.rightnow.com/customers-centers-for-medicare-and-medicaid.php"><u>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</u></a>, and <a href="http://www.rightnow.com/files/whitepapers/RN-Gov-in-a-Time-of-Change-white-paper.pdf"><u>U.S. Army Training Support Center</u></a> are among the more than 155 agencies that currently use knowledge management to improve citizen’s service experience, while reducing operating costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p class="MsoPlainText">In an era where terms like efficiency, transparency, and collaboration are not just goals, but mandates under the Obama administration, having a powerful knowledge foundation and market-leading on demand customer relationship management (CRM) solution helps meet these objectives. &nbsp;Recovery.gov and U.S. Federal agencies can leverage a unified knowledge foundation to share, monitor, and collaborate on information, while providing transparent open communication between themselves and their constituents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The amount of money involved in the recovery is beyond huge and it will be a debt we will be paying off&nbsp; for a long time. Making the information about how much and where we spend this money accessible to those of us who will pay those bills is not just critical, it's essential. The problem is often that government has a hard time boiling the data down so that it is understandable, consumable and available at the same time.</p>

<p>The good news is threre are tools and technolgies availble to help do this now - knowledge management tools today can alow you to get immediate feedback on wheter what is presented is understandable and provides usefull answers. Combined with a strong search engine in a multi channel (voice, chat, IVR, web) environment could make this datat accesible to all citizens - when they want it and where they want it. It would let them decide and comment back on wheter it told them what they wanted, allowing the government to adjust the presentation to make it consumable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Not to be too radical, but if we take the stance that each citizen is like a customer to normal businesses, then it is only natural that the more information that is available to the customer / citizen the better the service and the happier the customer / citizen.&nbsp; Now layer on that the citizens / constituents are also owners, the need for knowledge is even greater.&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely a tool that would allow the access and distribution of knowledge in an intelligent consolidated and unified way would be extremely helpful.&nbsp; Beats a three hour phone call…J</p>

				Enhanced Analysis and Visualization
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>An idea for both the topic listed above and some of the earlier suggestions about enhanced visualizations and analytics, I'd like to submit an example of some of the options that should be pursued.&nbsp; We generally find that the approaches that often fail in data management and analysis&nbsp;are too many lists, spreadsheets, and columns of data.&nbsp; By using interactive visualizations, providing different levels of aggregation, and giving more in-depth analysis only where desired, you can turn volumes of data into usable information.&nbsp; We've taken the data at Recovery.gov (up to and including the Financial and Activity Reports added last week (dated 4/17/09) and created an interactive, dynamic dashboard of all of the data.&nbsp; In this way, you can do some top-level analysis, comparing agencies to each other and looking at the program as a whole, but also look at the individual agency over time.&nbsp; Take a look at it and let us know what you think.&nbsp; Link: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.microstrategy.com/recovery-act-data/">http://www.microstrategy.com/recovery-act-data/</a></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>We believe the pages within&nbsp;RECOVERY.GOV should provide the end users with at least this level of interactivity and functionality, so that citizens can perform all the analysis they desire in an easy-to-understand and easy-to-use way.</p>

<p>Excellent idea -- I like that it is available as a prototype.&nbsp; I think that a number of these appraches can be bundled to create a more user friendly site.&nbsp; For example an enhanced mapping capability is also needed.&nbsp; Is this scalable for each state/locality.&nbsp; People want to see the big picture, and what's happening locally.</p>

<p>This is an excellent dashboard example.&nbsp; I particularly like the ability to animate the data over time!&nbsp;This&nbsp;single dashboard consolidates almost all the information that is available in over 100 spreadsheets on Recovery.gov, and it does so in a way that is visually appealing and easy to navigate.&nbsp; This would save lots of time for anyone interested in analyzing the Recovery data - whether public official or private citizen.<img class="image-inline image-inline" src="RecoveryAnalysis.jpg" alt="Recovery Data - animated over time" height="432" width="575" />&nbsp;</p>

				Stimulus Spending Transparency, analysis, outcomes and collaboration
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><strong>Stimulus Analytical Dashboard - Spending Data Transparency, Analytics, and Collaboration<br /></strong></p>
<p>The Stimulus Spending Analytics Dashboard enables operational and spending business intelligence to government agencies and tax payers to improve transparency, accountability, and collaboration.&nbsp; The dashboard solution enables agencies to optimize their supplier, grants, projects and spending performance by integrating disparate data from across the enterprise value chain and enabling decision makers to make more informed and actionable decisions.&nbsp; Utilization of pre-built dashboards and reports allows government agencies the ability to analyze fund allotments and spending details, review overall budget and financial performance, and improve timeliness and efficiency of payments.</p>
<p><strong><img class="image-inline image-inline" src="rec1.png/image_preview" alt="Progress by Federal Departments" /></strong></p>
<p>The Binary Fountain dashboard provides powerful financial metrics, alerts, and reports enabling agencies and departments to gain insight into budget execution and stimulus spending analyses and to take data driven action. At the highest level, the solution addresses government requirements in terms of tracking stimulus spending numbers, compliance, data capture, data analysis, utilization reporting, and job growth outcomes.</p>
<p><strong><img class="image-inline image-inline" src="rec2.png/image_preview" alt="Progress by States" /> </strong>- Integrated and Actionable Spending Insight<br /><br />The dashboard provides powerful financial metrics, alerts, and reports enabling agencies and departments to gain insight into budget execution and stimulus spending analyses and to take data driven action. At the highest level, the solution addresses government requirements in terms of tracking stimulus spending numbers, citizens collaboration, compliance, data capture, data analysis, utilization reporting, and job growth outcomes. <br /></p>
<p><strong><img class="image-inline image-inline" src="col.png/image_preview" alt="Citizen Collabaration" /></strong></p>
<p>The Dashboard collaboration module allows a public domain user to&nbsp; drill down to a specific transaction and initiate a collaboration thread.&nbsp;&nbsp; A user can upload pictures and blog on a stimulus transaction, therefore creating increased transparency, accountability and public trust.</p>
<p><strong><img class="image-inline image-inline" src="rec3.png/image_preview" alt="Distribution Analysis" /></strong></p>
<p>The Dashboard provides robust data analysis capabilities in order to track expenditures, utilization performance and jobs growth across an agency.&nbsp; The system calculates variances between actual spending versus targets (goals/indicators, project milestone dates and spending), and if needed, assigns performance ratings (e.g., red, yellow, green), and evaluate targets and/or actual performance for selected goals/indicators.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The dashboard solution leads to a more effective stimulus execution
process with increased reporting accuracy and accountability, along
with effectively tracking jobs growth outcomes.&nbsp; Agencies using the
Binary Fountain Dashboard will benefit from:<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comprehensive stimulus spending and procurement analysis<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increased insight and visibility into the payables and suppliers performance<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Citizens Collaboration and accountability</p>
<p>The Recovery and Reinvestment Act is an extraordinary response to a crisis unlike any since the Great Depression. With much at stake, the Binary Fountain Dashboard provides unprecedented levels of transparency and accountability so that you will be able to know how, when, and where stimulus dollars are being spent.<br /><br /></p>

				Establish A National Terminology As A Shared Reference
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Provide a National Terminology as a shared reference for all Federal Activities and for all those receiving Federal Funds.&nbsp; A&nbsp;full terminology would consist of a series of information structures built in layers.&nbsp; These semantic layers, from foundation to top, are:</p>
<ol start="1"><li><em>Creation of Content by authors.</em> </li><li><em>Inventory of content</em> stores (operational structured content as data, analytical structured content as data, semistructured content such as email, and unstructured content such as documents, spreadsheets, and presentation files) </li><li><em>Term extraction</em> from content, tied to source and author metadata </li><li><em>Term definition</em>(s) from authors, groups, organizations, standards-bodies, national and global dictionaries, etc. </li><li><em>Concept maps</em> as Directed Labeled Graphs (<em>DLG</em>) with underlying <em>triples</em>, as <em>concepts of operation,</em>&nbsp;<em>conceptual data models, or OV2</em>&nbsp;(Expandible to <em>logical&nbsp;data models</em> in <strong>ERD </strong>or ORM format and <strong>physical data models</strong> in <em>DDL</em>, <em>XML/XSD</em>, <em>RDF/RDFS</em>, or <em>OWL</em>. Further expandible to <em>ontologies and knowledge-bases</em> using RDF/RDFS or OWL (with an <em>Enterprise Architecture</em> metamodel being anontology and the EA content being a knowledge-base).&nbsp; Further elaborating the ontology or EA would then lead to the ability to build an <em>axiology</em> showing&nbsp;subject-activity sequences, and thus subject-activity dependencies, and thus subject-activity <em>value-streams, value-chains, and priorities</em>.&nbsp; (All of DODAF fits here, and some of OMB FEA) </li><li><em>Taxonomies</em> to categorize broader and narrower meanings and their terms&nbsp; (and to serve as master-metadata and master-data for organization-wide lookup tables) (Some of OMB FEA fits here) </li><li><em>Thesaurus</em> for identifying preferred and alternate terms within a domain, including acronyms, aliases, abbreviations, and alternate spellings, all as a means to <em>translate jargon across domains</em> and <em>translate&nbsp;across natural languages</em>. </li><li><em>Refinement</em> of terminology by cycling from item 1 back to item 7.</li></ol>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>A shared and governed terminology would dramatically reduce the complexity and cost of accurately interfacing cultures, organizations, workforces, processes, data, and technologies.&nbsp; If built from the top of a domain, it is less costly and more effective than building from the bottom up.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Whatever format is used for the data, it should be highly exportable. Doing this will enable the public to massage/analyze the data any way that they choose. Otherwise, it is going to be difficult to come up with a format that pleases everyone</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>It informs the general public and also provides access to the data for anyone that wants deeper analysis.</p>

<p>This is critically important.&nbsp; The growing number of "mashups" - that combine data from multiple sources, to address specific needs and interests, is testament to the need to make data available in usable and "composeable" forms, rather than trying to funnel all information through a pre-defined set of tools.&nbsp; There is growing literature to this effect, particularly as regards design of municipal information sites, and, as I seem to recall, the administration's new CIO and CTO are both strong proponents of this approach as well.</p>

<p>Data Formats are extremely important, and many programs and applications try to lock users into their proprietary format, But raw data is the real useful data, this is what people are going to be doing their analysis with, and what people want access to. when it comes down to it, most of the people doign research are familiar with spreadsheets, whether it is CSV's, Microsoft Excel, or Open Office as an open source alternative. People can ussually get spreadsheet data into any format that they need for their specific need. I'm involved in web-based mapping, and a lot of what we do is converting spreadsheets into interactive maps. just my 2 cents.</p>

<h1>
				8th Grade Basal Reading Level of Data Aggregation in Visual form
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>To meet the fundamental goals of a publicly accessible and understandable forum for Recovery.gov as a place where the public can monitor the expenditure and use of recovery funds data must be presented in a format keyed to the average reading level (ca. 8th), and further aggregated in an overtly simplistic way through a declining funds remaining bar, with a national and state based navigation interface.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The vast majority of the public relies on news agency data aggregation because 20 (small local level) page excel printouts are too complex.&nbsp; On a state level, the budget may exceed 400 pages, and on a federal level the budget easily exceeds 20,000 line-item pages of payees.</p>
<p>to be "transparent and publicly accessible" the page needs a simple interface, on the main page, with a declining fund bar (perhaps "cute") and a image hotmap allowing the public to key into local areas of interest to see how funds are being distributed in relevant agencies that affect their life.</p>
<p>What currently exists is woefully inadequate, nontransparent, obfuscated, and currently disappointing.</p>
<p>This should not require billions to implement, and should be no more complicated than the websites that presidential candidates would display to convey information and financial information/fundraising progress.</p>

<p>This is an excellent idea.&nbsp; Not only for those that only have a basic 8th grade reading level, but also for those of us that don't desire for their eyes to cross when trying to decipher the legal-speak and translate it into basic English again.</p>

<p>I consider myself to be educated enough to understand at least up to a high school graduate's reading level, and yet I find it very difficult to easily understand half of what the government releases to the general public as "transparent information".&nbsp; How can it be transparent if too few people actually understand it?</p>

<p>Aside from that, the even greater benefit would be that we can show our children (depending on age level of course), and actually get them involved in the affairs of the country again.&nbsp; It would be nice if those children 8th grade and up could understand the information to be better educated adults.&nbsp; The more information we can give them before they enter adulthood, the better they will be prepared to assist the rest of us with ideas and volunteer work when they are older.</p>

<p>I was just looking through some of the ideas and approaches that have been recently posted and came across this one. I agree with your concern that although it is an appreciated effort they are making, but with the disparity of the data it is very difficult to make sense of, or make any kind of informed conclusions..

<h1>
				The Crux Of The Issue: Trusted Information 
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The Obama pledge for transparency along with the recent OMB Recovery Act Guidance has created something of a burning fuse for the administration, presenting a great risk both to the credibility of The White House, and the success of the Recovery Act investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;While current studies show general support across the nation for the stimulus effort, there lingers a degree of skepticism amongst the Congress, the citizenry and the media in the ability of the government to administer the investments fairly, effectively, and without widespread corruption and fraud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, Obama has made transparency and accountability a centerpiece of his presidency.&nbsp;&nbsp; From his Inaugural address:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><span class="large"><em>“Those of us who manage the public’s dollars will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.”</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More fundamentally, however, the Recovery Act is intended to go far beyond serving as a mechanism for stimulating the economy. It inherently calls for a transformation in the relationship between the government and its citizenry, long after the last stimulus dollar has been spent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here’s the burning fuse:&nbsp; While the current body of thought has focused primarily on the methods for collecting reports, the real crux of the matter lies in how the OMB and Recovery.gov,&nbsp;in concert with funding agencies from across the ecosystem, can ensure that the information presented in the reports is accurate, complete, and consistent; and in the degree to which the public is able to drill into the information across agencies and to a level of detail sufficient to convince them that the information can be trusted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The credibility of Recovery.gov, and indeed the credibility of the administration, &nbsp;lies chiefly in the trust and confidence across the government, citizenry and media that there exists straightforward access to relevant spending and impact information, and that this information is both accurate and complete – even though the sources of this information lie across a complex ecosystem of heterogeneous federal, state and local agencies, as well as private interests -- each with existing investments in program management, business processes and underlying infrastructure and data models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine this:&nbsp; On October 10 citizens log on to Recovery.gov, and being to poke around.&nbsp; They see that Recovery.gov is reporting the results of an investment program that has been put in place across several states -- X number of jobs produced, with Y $$'s of investment.&nbsp; These numbers are the aggregates from several states.&nbsp; Yet, when the individual drills into those states, or goes directly to the individual state websites, the numbers don't add up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Result:&nbsp; Loss of credibility in the results of the Recovery Act investments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Ultimately, the PERCEIVED success of the Recovery Act is not so much about managing funds as it is about the enormous challenge of managing <u>information</u> – ensuring the information is reliable and readily accessible in real time.</em></strong></p>
<p>Our clients tell us that while they need to move in the short term to standup a capability to meet the reporting mandates, longer term they need to develop a new level of agility to respond to the evolving demands of the new stimulus management environment. At the highest level, they need the tools to streamline and more efficiently manage the proposal and grant processes, and engage in strategic decision making. They need both broad and detailed views of stimulus-related information and processes, made possible through robust dashboards and scorecards.&nbsp;&nbsp; They need solid transactional and operational reports, for both internal and citizen centric reporting.&nbsp;&nbsp; To track how they are spending their funds and the progress of the agencies they support, they need sophisticated project and performance management capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Above all, they need tools to ensure that they can trust the information they are using to optimize their investment, and to share across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second set of guidance from OMB points to the development of a central facility for collecting reports from funding agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; In developing this facility and providing further guidance to the funding agencies OMB should strive 1) to create a standardized data model that 2) allows the bi-directional flow of information; and 2) to ensure data quality, accuracy and completeness; and 3) consistent reporting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a more detailed level, based on our ongoing conversations with Federal and State &amp; Local funding agencies the OMB should keep the following architectural guidelines in mind – both as it provides further guidance and in developing its own capabilities:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Trusted Information is the key to the success of Recovery.gov.&nbsp; If the information is easily accessible, AND is accurate, complete and consistent, faith in the Recovery Act is maintained.&nbsp; If it is innacurate, or hard to access -- credibility is lost, and the publis loses faith in the Recovery Act Itself.</p>

<p>Consequently, while the initial strain on reporting and information sharing architectures will rest on a small number of weekly reports, both the Transparency Board and supporting Federal Agencies should assume that over time the public will demand Real Time visibility into investments and results, supported by real time analysis and dashboarding.

<p>There are many excellent ideas on this site which address systems, processes and communication of information, but the most critical component to the Recovery Act program is transparency and accountability of our tax dollars being allocated, committed and spent and the associated results. Without a construction project management system, regardless of delivery method (SaaS, On Premise, hybrid) enforcing procedures and processes behind projects we cannot be certain of the validity of the information being presented.</p>

<p>SaaS means is you give the data to some other entity and use their software to have it do what you want. The problem is when a bug is found or you need a new feature, you are really at the mercy of the SaaS provider. That is why I would prefer Recovery.gov run its own infrastructure and data access methods.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean they have to reinvent the wheel. There are more tools than ever that are available under free software licenses to handle large amounts of data, do reporting, ERP, and all kinds of other tasks for which proprietary vendors are proposing their solutions. In addition any code that is written for this purpose should be made available for public review and improvement. Together we can do much more.</p>

<h1>
				Full collaboration, transparency and reporting
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Provide a powerful, turn-key system that will provide two primary functions.&nbsp; First, provide Recovery.gov the tools necessary to manage, administer and track the funding allocations.&nbsp; A tool that would allow collaboration across the agencies that are involved in the management of the stimulus funding as well as workflow, policy and procedural control and visibility. This would ensure all the relevant data is in one place.&nbsp; This tool could and should be used by every organization receiving stimulus funding. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, provide a “Faceplate” that would allow anyone to point and click to track who received funding, what the entity is (financial, government agency, private industry etc.), where they are located, when they received the funding, and why.&nbsp; The public could view not only where the funding went, but what policies and procedures were followed to grant the funding.&nbsp; The why is especially important.&nbsp; It’s from the why that we can determine if the funding was well spent.&nbsp; What were the goals and requirements of the funding and are they being met?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teamcenter by Siemens, implemented and hosted by Computer Sciences Corporation is just such a tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>First, having the on line collaboration ability that crosses departmental boundaries is vital in getting the funds allocated as quickly as possible.&nbsp; This also allows the data to be in one place which in turn allows analysis and reporting to take place equally as effectively.&nbsp; It also allows quick, effective auditing to be accomplished as all the information is centrally located.&nbsp; And most importantly, it provides the transparency that is to be the cornerstone of the stimulus effort.&nbsp; The public could have ready, point and click access to not only what funding was allocated to who and where, but what policy or procedure was followed to get it there, and if the project is meeting its intended goals.&nbsp; This would remove any doubt as to the effectiveness of the effort in all offerings.</p>

<p>A comprehensive solution is necessary to meet the unprecedented goals of this recovery effort.&nbsp; In fact, unprecedented levels of cooperation between government and the private sector will be needed.&nbsp; I think that the partnership of CSC and Siemens Government Services combined with product suite that Teamcenter offers can help the government collaborate with all stakeholders in the recovery effort.&nbsp; The IT solution, Teamcenter, that is proposed is more than a point solution (of which there have been many excellent suggestions in this dialog).&nbsp; It is an IT backbone and functionality that allows for collaboration on many levels.&nbsp; It provides for a single, authoritative database for all users.&nbsp; It can be implemented anywhere in the organizational hierarchy from the Federal Government executive level to the agencies, down to the states and the local project level.&nbsp; It matters not where in the process of procurement or project implementation when the Teamcenter tool is implemented as it is an open architecture and can import all manner of data and formats.&nbsp; It leverages nearly all of any participant's&nbsp;current IT investment and in other solutions and does not proclude the use of other point solutions.&nbsp; The differentiator in the Teamcenter product is that it allows the requirements of any given program or project to be defined, decomposed, and linked to tasks and deliverables.&nbsp; This way, the goals for each and every recovery program/project can be defined in terms of specific requirements and&nbsp;projects can be viewed within the context of those concrete requirements.</p>

Don't do ANY new development!&nbsp; Go with a COTS tool that is proven.&nbsp; I've never worked directly with TEAMCENTER, but I've known several major programs that used it and have been very successful with it, and I can recommend it heartily.&nbsp;&nbsp; #2.&nbsp; Don't let any in-house government IT department develop a new tool "tailored" for your unique needs.&nbsp; Won't work.&nbsp; And don't let an in-house organ operate it or sustain one that you buy.&nbsp; With all due respect to govt IT organizations...they don't need to be developing or learning something new while they are supporting you, a myriad of teammates, and the public---unless of course you don't want to start this project for a decade or so.&nbsp; Get&nbsp;off the mark quickly and stay ahead of the game.&nbsp;If Computer Science Company has a history with the TEAMCENTER tool, that is a good thing for YOU.&nbsp;Leave the DB hosting/administration to proven experts. #3. Don't believe everything you hear from salesmen in regard to how easy it will be for all your teammates to access and use.&nbsp; I selected a collaboration tool from a major IT company once, because "everyone" from all your subs, yadda yadda yadda, can use it.&nbsp; All too late, we discovered that "everyone" meant "everyone who used that IT company's email system."&nbsp; Unfortunately for us...not everyone DID use that suite of tools.&nbsp; The safest way to know what you are getting and to get max support from the product owners is to buy the seats you need and provide them to your teammates.&nbsp;This will give you more control and a better chance at success.&nbsp; Go with one that is web&nbsp;-based and platform agnostic.&nbsp;&nbsp;#4. Don't get&nbsp;some random "training" company to do your training for you....as cheap as some companies will promise to do trainng...make sure they KNOW the system and have bona fide credentials training users <strong>on the tool that you select</strong>.&nbsp; Make them prove their qualifications BEFORE you commit to them.&nbsp;#5 Buy American.&nbsp; The recovery funds are for OUR recovery...use American companies in your collaboration and information transparency tool.&nbsp; Many people may use this site, they will be turned off if part of your funds were spent off shore.&nbsp; I looked up Siemens and CSC--they are both global but Siemens has 69,000 US workers (HQ in Plano TX) and CSC has about the same number of US employees.&nbsp; By now all large companies are "global", but ALL the recovery funds should stay here.&nbsp; #6 Have everything in "one sock".&nbsp; Find a tool where all the data you are presenting is in ONE DB and can be presented&nbsp;from one site.&nbsp; Having a site that is little more than a customer interface that facilitates a user's access to multiple other sites (i.e., a list of other websites or a set of hotlinks)...each maintained by a separate teammember, each&nbsp;with&nbsp;different looks and protocols and prompts and commands and response times is no good.&nbsp; Some of these other sites will have access problems, down time problems, bandwidth and capacity problems....don't buy into that.&nbsp; Your tool needs to be one that YOU can see and AUDIT anytime you want to.&nbsp; MAKE IT A REQUIREMENT ON EVERY FUND RECIPIENT THAT THEY KEEP UP THEIR DATA IN YOUR SITE!&nbsp; #7.

<p>It is great that this program can be used by any orgnization receiving stimulus funds and also having all data in one location is very effective.&nbsp;This program will also help get funds allocated quicker which is a greater use of the taxpayers dollars.</p>

<p>This is a great idea for two reasons.&nbsp; The most important is transparency.&nbsp; Hopefully, public scrutiny of the the funds-disbursement process, the organizations receiving the funds, and the details of the projects themselves, will ensure the money is well spent.&nbsp; Second, this tool will promote efficiency in the execution of the projects.&nbsp; Having worked on projects that involved mutliple goverment and private organizations, I can vouch for the fact that the ability to keep all project-related technical data, quotations, purchase orders, schedules, and progress reports in one place, and all project related-communications flowing through the same&nbsp;tool (including a permanent record of all communications and attached documentation) will speed up execution&nbsp; of the projects, reduce errors in execution, and reduce administrative costs.</p>

<p>A tool to provide accountability of stimulus funding and a record of agency collaboration&nbsp;is a necessity to maintain&nbsp;public confidence in those tasked with the disbursement of funds. Cross departmental and/or agency information brought together&nbsp;in a central repository can only enhance&nbsp;the measurement of the effectiveness of the overall effort and ensure effective communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h1>
				Use the tools you know and the software you trust
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Although there have been many posts with great ideas trying to define transparency and ideas on how to display and present data on recovery.gov, there needs to be more discussion on the significant problem in addressing the quality, source, and cost of the data that will be collected and accessible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ARRA is pushing an unprecedented amount of funding, in an exceptionally accelerated pace into our government bureaucracies – federal, state, local, and educational institutions are facing an enormous challenge in:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identifying the funding source (and requirements)</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Processing&nbsp;funds (either as a grantee, grantor, or both)</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Managing funded and proposed projects from start to finish</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating all mandatory program and funding reports&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Defining ‘transparency’ and what data to collect</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn’t really anything new. Governments at all levels have been processing different funding streams for a long time, and will be after ARRA dollars are spent.&nbsp; What is unique at this moment in time is the scale of and requirement for creating a single view into all related ‘stimulus’ monies.&nbsp; These challenges are magnified by the lack of definition of ‘transparency’ combined with growing citizen’s expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, a report from the State of Minnesota is the best summary of the ‘find the money’ challenge&nbsp;I have seen to date - <a href="http://www.mmb.state.mn.us/doc/citizen/summary.pdf"><u>http://www.mmb.state.mn.us/doc/citizen/summary.pdf</u></a> - hundreds of funding sources to find and track – interesting to note the summary of the Federal legislation is coming from a State, and unfortunately every State is spending energy doing the same analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dialog within these pages itself clearly exemplifies the diversity of perception in what defines ‘transparency’.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>So why is the quality and sourcing of data&nbsp;so important?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although ARRA provides much needed funding for Federal, State and Education related programs it does not specifically provide assistance to help the government agencies in charge of managing and reporting on the use of those funds with the tools to help them with this process and to put those dollars to work quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the need to report on how federal and state funds are being applied is not new, the challenge to manage the multiple reporting and transparency requirements, where the entities need to report back, in what format, and how do they ultimately make this information open to the public, is affecting all levels of government today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If recovery.gov is going to be successful in the promise of delivering unprecedented access to information – the promise that data will be gathered and organized in ways never seen before - the participants of ARRA funding need help in collecting quality data.&nbsp; They need tools to help them so that ‘finding the money source’ and ‘collecting the data’ are not the primary job.&nbsp; Tools that help them effectively move funds through the system and get resources where they are needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer lies in taking advantage of platform solutions that are based on easy to use tools and technologies that these organizations use (and likely own already) today, so government agencies can quickly mobilize and put stimulus dollars to work, with confidence they will be able to comply with evolving reporting requirements and ultimately exceed citizen’s expectations for transparency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have spent a lot of time talking to our customers and they have asked us for “easy to use” tools that can help them capture data at all points in a process, track funded programs with different objectives, monitor progress with varying timelines, and provide intuitive views of the data for different audiences.&nbsp; We have been asked for a answer that can support known key performance indicators and government-backed performance metrics, automated workflow, and comprehensive analysis across consolidated data sources – but flexible enough to quickly accommodate future requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To that end, Microsoft made a commitment to help customers by creating a solution that can meet these objectives.&nbsp; We worked closely with numerous partners and customers across the country and in the spirit of economic recovery created a set of solution accelerators that, with limited resource and effort, are available for customers and partners to implement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Stimulus360 solution is now available as templates to download directly, for partners to implement, or hosting providers to deliver.&nbsp; It will help government organizations and educational institutions to quickly mobilize and track federal funding sources, requirements, and grant submission processes. It manages incoming resources, facilitates downstream funding requests, tracks funded projects, and tracks allocated resources. The solution provides an effective means of compiling results, satisfying reporting requirements, and publishing content to citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments can use the Microsoft Stimulus360 solution immediately to:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manage and track all ARRA fund sources</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manage and track all ARRA funded projects within your jurisdiction</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integrate with your existing financial, grant, and project systems to provide a central ARRA repository</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Produce all mandatory ARRA reports and progress</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide business intelligence to visual data, processes, and goals with scorecards and geospatial analysis</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide a central source for data, documents, and reports</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Search documents and data internally and ARRA sites externally</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide full auditing of all data out of the box to track any changes to the data</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Federal, State and local governments that deploy the Microsoft Stimulus360 solution benefit from:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Automatic capture of actions and events to facilitate quick, informed decisions and to improve transparency.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integration with familiar applications including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Office Outlook and Microsoft Office Excel, to reduce the learning curve.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geospatial features that link data and mapping capabilities, providing the visual component that allows our elected officials, and the public to see the impact that Recovery efforts are having at the national, state, and smallest of local level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many agencies that currently use Microsoft applications will find that most of the pieces needed may already be in use, which could lead to lower training cost and quicker adoption rates.&nbsp; Microsoft Stimulus360 can be deployed on-premise, or government customers can choose to take advantage of hosted options to meet fluctuating demand and to help minimize deployment costs. The Stimulus360 solution does not require extensive consultant engagement or services contracts to deploy. Federal, State and local governments and their tax-paying citizens are counting on a rapid and positive impact of the federal stimulus program. The right technology can help ARRA participants manage the funds appropriately to create needed jobs and to contribute to the national economic recovery – and the effort will provide useful solutions beyond the current ARRA cycle.&nbsp; This will drive results, and in turn will dramatically improve the quality of information available on recovery.gov.&nbsp; This is not a magic bullet, not the right answer for everyone, and still requires hard work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology does not solve problems, people do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the tools you know and the software you trust.</p>

<p>Stimulus 360 is an incredible solution that is taking off rapidly. I've been reading in the blogs that Harris County, TX and City of San Francisco have just acquired it for their needs. What makes it compelling is that it can be installed onsite or run in the cloud. Thank you, Microsoft!!!</p>

<p>What I distill from this post is that it's possible for government agencies to manage their budgets and performance with tools that they probably already own.&nbsp; Familiar Microsoft products are generally easy-to-use and scale up and down, based on an organization's need.&nbsp; In this case, I think stuartmckee has framed it exactly - I'm encouraged by this opportunity to evaluate Stimulus360 even further.</p>

<p>The Stimulus 360 solution proposed by Microsoft would be an excellent choice for managing this complex program. It provides a comprehensive solution with an integrated set of products from a known entity. This minimizes the risks of integration and compatibility issues between products, it taps into the resources of large, well respected software development company, and it avoids the inevitable finger-pointing that occurs&nbsp;when applications from different companies are integrated and technical support issues arise.</p>

<p>Everyone in my organization uses Microsoft tools and I am thrilled that Microsoft has released an end to end solution to help us with this capability. Our job is to spend this money wisely, be accountable for how we do it, and share this information transparently with the public. I have researched this tool and it looks like an absolutely perfect fit. I think more people need to know about it.</p>

<p>I agree.&nbsp; No matter what the source of the data, or how its stored or transferred, or how its structured, it has zero quality if its meaning is not transferred from source to viewer.&nbsp; A structured terminology process is needed to ensure that what is presented by the source is what was meant, and what is perceived by the viewer is what was presented.</p>

<h1>
				NASA-Sponsored Technology for Recovery Act Tracking
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><strong>TeamLeader</strong> (tm) , a NASA-sponsored technology ideal for Recovery Act tracking --&nbsp;<a href="http://recovery.teamhost.com" target="_blank"><u>http://recovery.teamhost.com</u></a> -- is a management accountability and&nbsp;reporting system for overseeing the progress and performance of government projects.&nbsp; It can be implemented immediately&nbsp;from the GSA schedule.&nbsp; Here is a case study of how NASA uses TeamLeader (tm)&nbsp;to manage one of its compex Lunar projects:<br /><a href="http://nasateam.com/uploads/casestudy.pdf" target="_blank"><u>http://nasateam.com/uploads/casestudy.pdf</u></a></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>We want recovery now: so we want more than concepts later, we want capability now.&nbsp; As agencies scramble to adapt spreadsheet and related systems to jury-rig a disparate variety of stove-piped Recovery Act tracking systems, in fact, a Web 2.0-based system&nbsp;ideal for exactly this purpose has been validated at NASA.&nbsp; Call it "the right time and the right place."&nbsp; NASA-sponsored technology may set the pace for how agencies can track Recovery Act money from spending to real results.&nbsp; Here is the background ... In 2008, I was asked to address a seminar for NASA managers on using Web 2.0 for business improvement.&nbsp; Cary Landis, seminar leader and&nbsp;CEO of Virtual Global Technologies, knew of my work in the corporate world, plus service at GAO and nearly a decade in the Executive Office of the President.&nbsp; (I served at OMB and later as team leader of the Science &amp; Technology Team for the National Performance Review Task Force. So I know something about real-world government spending, accountability and results.)&nbsp; Fortunately, our audience at the Glenn Research Center included managers who really "get it."&nbsp; The lunar project staff forged ahead with piloting and proving the TeamLeader (tm) performance management and reporting system.&nbsp; Based on Virtual Global's technology proven by organizations such as The Pampered Chef corporation and endorsed by the intelligence division of the Seattle Police Department, NASA's Web implementation proved so successful that Mark Hyatt from NASA's Advanced Capabilities Office was asked to&nbsp;present it in detail at the agency's annual "Management 2.0" conference this past Febuary 2009 in Florida.&nbsp; ( <a href="http://nasateam.com/uploads/casestudy.pdf">http://nasateam.com/uploads/casestudy.pdf</a>&nbsp;) The NASA configuration of TeamLeader (tm) can be rapidly customized for particular agencies and programs (the system's "toolset" cuts implementation time and costs by more than a quarter).&nbsp; Results can feed real-time into successive roll-ups at department and OMB levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a fully secure Web 2.0 system (it is the only system in the world that includes a breakthrough NIST patent for Role-Based Access Control), TeamLeader (tm) scales across all levels of government; can connect to pre-existing budget and management systems; can plug-into Google Maps and other capabilities; gives managers real project visibility; automatically "roles up" reports for review; and where appropriate, can help to automate Web publishing.&nbsp; John Hale - MINDWEST Strategies</p>

<p>Sounds like "good enough." I agree with the author that a fast start is most important. And if data is available over the internet in a consistent, defined, accessible format then continual experimentation can take place with the front end.</p>

<p>I just checked the NASA weekly report.&nbsp; NASA hasn't yet disbursed or even obligated any of its allocated ARRA funds.&nbsp; I think that initial evidence is that NASA is suffering from bureaucratic fiscal drag the same as most other parts of the government.&nbsp; They may have some great trademarked management tools, but they have to be used to do any good.</p>

<p>I agree that the interaction between agencies that are involved in the data flows supporting the movement of data from the many sources to the various consolidation points would be greatly enhanced through the use of SOAP and XML.&nbsp; In fact, the standard eXtensible Business Reporting Language or XBRL is an XML schema or data model that was created to support financial management and the processes associated with large scale data traffic.&nbsp; The use of SOAP, XML with XBRL along with the Java Messaging Service or JMS will provide an open standards based framework that can scale from very small instances to very large bulk data traffic.&nbsp; This is a much more robust approach to interfacing discrete disparate systems than what is generally achieved with syndication style feeds.&nbsp; Have a look at the discussion on <em><strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-think43/">Thinking XML: Analyze financial reporting using XBRL.</a></strong></em></p>

<p>I also believe the government should only rarely dictate technical details of "how" something is shared. It's too easy for the focus to be "this must be XML" or "this must be JSON" and the agency can meet the expecations of that declaration by supplying a XML file 1 minute per day.</p>

<p>If we can pull people's focus a little higher for a time and agree on standards of availability and accounting consistency I have no doubt that the technical savvy among us can render semantic implementation details like JSON vs. XML vs. WSDL irrelevant.</p>

<p>While the idea of "XML Web Services" is a good one and should be pursued, it should not be done in the flavor of SOAP services. Instead, RESTful HTTP can deliver XML in a more Web-compatible way, and also is much more accessible in terms of required technologies. For example, mobile devices nowadays often have HTTP and XML support built-in, but using SOAP (and in particular potentially complex WS-* profiles) is not readily possible, and sometimes almost impossible because of device limitations. the use of <a href="http://journal.webscience.org/46/">Plain Web</a> technologies is a better foundation for data that should be as open, usable, and accessible as possible for the widest possible range of users, devices, and applications.</p>

<h1>
				Making stimulus spending data accessible to the public
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Federal agencies as well as recipients of stimulus money are required to report certain spending and performance data for aggregation on Recovery.gov. This mandate provides an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability over investment of stimulus dollars. It also provides agencies with a complex new reporting requirement that must be rolled out fairly quickly.</p>
<p>To meet the accountability and transparency objectives of the Act, agencies and prime recipients must have the ability to provide ARRA-mandated reports meeting the following criteria:</p>
<ul><li>Provided in a timely and accurate manner</li><li>Accessible to the public and searchable (discoverable) using readily available search technologies</li><li>Published in a structured format (as opposed to unstructured text formats) to facilitate value-added data aggregation and analysis</li></ul>
<p>The easiest way to accomplish this with the least amount of risk is to implement a distributed reporting architecture leveraging widely available Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) - based web standards and technologies such as extensible markup language (XML), Really Simple Syndication (RSS), Atom, extensible hypertext markup language (XHTML), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Comma-separated values (CSV), keyhole markup language for geo-encoding&nbsp;(KML), representational state transfer (REST), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and other modern data access standards.&nbsp; In this scenario, agencies and prime recipients would perform the following actions:</p>
<ul><li>Extract ARRA-mandated data elements from relevant backoffice systems (e.g., financial management systems, grants management systems, etc.) using an appropriate data access application programming interface (API) (e.g., JDBC)</li><li>Transform those data elements into ARRA – mandated reports such as funding notification reports, periodic financial reports, and award-level reporting</li><li>Publish ARRA – mandated reports to the Web as "data feeds" using one or more of the aforementioned formats as appropriate. Once published to the web, these feeds could then be combined in value-added ways using “mash-ups,” a popular state-of-the-art web development technique.&nbsp; They can also be harvested and aggregated by Recovery.gov.</li><li>Provide a "sitemap" using the popular Sitemaps standard (<a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/">http://www.sitemaps.org/</a>) to make it easy for subscribers to find all of your feeds </li></ul>
<p>Once these remote data feeds have been published, the Recovery.gov website can aggregate them on an ongoing basis using readily available "spider" or web crawler technology.&nbsp; The "spider" essentially visits each data feed on a regular, ongoing basis, checks it for changes, parses it, and posts it to a local index or data mart.&nbsp; This index is then used by Recovery.gov as a data store to allow the public to search and perform analytics on stimulus spending.</p>
<p>There are numerous readily available technologies, both commercial and open source, to implement the features described in this article.&nbsp; For example, Unisys has developed a Recovery Act reporting solution that can extract ARRA data elements from their host systems, aggregate them into ARRA-mandated reports, and publish those reports to the web as RSS / Atom feeds, KML feeds for geospatial visualization, CSV for spreadsheet integration, and custom XML vocabularies for integration with other applications. The Unisys Recovery Act reporting solution was developed using various open source enterprise Java technologies, and will integrate with most Government web hosting environments.</p>

<p>Take it one step further, though.&nbsp; All data on recovery.gov itself should be provided as feeds also.&nbsp; This would allow interested citizens to build their own analysis tools to mine the information according to their interests. Instead of having just transparency, you then have a whole army of concerned people augmenting the work of the GAO and other watchdogs!</p>

<p>I personally favor the use of atom feeds over SOAP, just because it is a lighter-weight format.</p>

<p>I'm one of the Berkeley researchers mentioned above involved with making recommendations on how data feeds should be use to make the recovery more transparent (see http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/newsandevents/news/20090417recoveryguidelines and http://isd.ischool.berkeley.edu/stimulus/2009-029/)</p>

<p>Although some (but not all) agencies receiving and dispersing recovery funds are using feeds in their reporting (see a list that we compiled at http://isd.ischool.berkeley.edu/stimulus/feeds/feeds.html), the best data on dollars appropriated, obligated, or spent is in the Excel spreadsheets.&nbsp; Although there are apparently templates for the reports, they keep changing format and there's nothing to stop agencies from inserting extra fields or omitting other fields.&nbsp;&nbsp; We know this for a fact since we've written programs to scrape the data from the spreadsheets and find it a challenge to keep up with changes that keep breaking our scripts.</p>

<p>This proposal hits squarely within the sweet spot that Federal CIO Vivek Kundra pursued while CTO of the District of Columbia, and the success of this approach is plain to see in the results of the Apps for Democracy effort.&nbsp; Beyond the basic concept of lightweight, easy-to-use data formats and feeds, effort and care should be taken to ensure that adequate metadata is provided, documenting source and lineage, completeness, timeliness and accuracy - many examples of these types of approaches exist.&nbsp; Metadata is critical toward informed decisionmaking and limiting liability and error&nbsp; Additionally, discovery these types of resources should be facilitated, again a variety of approaches toward data discovery exist, such as OpenSearch.&nbsp; And finally, this type of effort should be supported on a federated basis, where individual stakeholders can easily stand up their own interoperable, standards-based services using Open Source and/or COTS tools.&nbsp; The closer the data is to its source, the more likely it is to be current, complete and reliable.&nbsp; These types of federated approaches, if using vendor-neutral, platform-agnostic and standards-based technologies geared toward interoperability, can easily be aggregated in a variety of means.</p>

<h1>
				Single Reporting system for grants using BPM
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The federal agencies should provide one single system that will track grants from the moment they are awarded and allow the grantees and sub grantees to be able to report back through that tracking system.</p>
<p>While this concept may seem impossible to traditional grants management IT folks, the technology is readily available and can be implemented very quickly. The technology is Business Process Management (BPM). The leading BPM vendor, Appian Corporation, can implement such as system in a matter of months with effective security to ensure data integrity. Appian does that for the USArmy now with 2 million users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The idea is important because: 1) six months from now when grantees are expected to report back on performance and ROI on the investment from these grants, there is going to be very wide discrepancy between what the federal agencies report and what the grantees report. This is due to the lack of standardization and mechanisms available to the grantees and the sub grantees; 2) there is currently no single reporting system available that all grantees and sub grantees can afford; 3) the federal agencies would save millions of dollars in reconciliation expenses</p>

<p>While BPM is a technical concept, the reality is that there are only less than a handful of unique grant types, and many folks in govt beleive that managing a grant is not much different than administering a contract.&nbsp; Regardless, the Recovery Act requires speed and scalability of agency operations.&nbsp; Using BPM, agencies could standardize on a high quality grants administration approach, within types of grants, and grants admin could be synchronized with financial systems to get controls in place.&nbsp; This buy once, use many approach may be the only way for agencies to rapidly get the capacity and controls that are&nbsp;needed for the Recovery Act.</p>

<p>CapEx Manager is a market tested solutions that will allow the Federal Government to reach its goal of full transparency and accountability as the&nbsp;American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is carried out across the county. The software will allow each participating organization to effectively manage day-to-day operations throughout their entire Program Lifecycle.&nbsp; Data flows seamlessly between each phase of the program, from bid preparation, to procurement, through&nbsp;project management, to project closeout.&nbsp;The system enables issues to be managed and resolved as they surface, information to be viewed,&nbsp;and costs and schedules&nbsp;to be controlled.&nbsp; Through the course of each project, the public entity responsible for the project, the federal government, and citizens will have real-time views on how their project is progressing, where issues exist and what is being done to&nbsp;make certain the project is being delivered in an appropriate manner.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This type of solution is extremely important.&nbsp; As identified by the act itself, there is a requirement for full transparency of all expenditures of dollars that fund this initiative.&nbsp; Taxpayers be able to know how, when, and where there tax dollars are being spent.&nbsp; Those spending the dollars should also have the tools to adequately manage the projects being funded.</p>

<p>If this solution provides an audit trail of all program management capital expenditures with construction detail and payments, as well as all activities tied to contractors and sub-contractors awarded to a project, it would be a valuable tool for government oversight of the use of recovery funds. Also,&nbsp;if this solution tracks WBE and&nbsp;MBE participation, it would be invaluable toward tracking and identifiying who is benefiting from these&nbsp;construction activities.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>If we are not careful, we can make tracking the Recovery more complicated and confusing than it needs to be.&nbsp; EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRACK THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RECOVERY.&nbsp; Our idea is to place a simple tracking tool on the desktop and mobile phone of every American in the United States.&nbsp; PushBI is being used to help businesses track their performance today and will help the government track their performance and provide total transparency to the American people.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Our government wants to provide the highest transparency possible to every American.&nbsp; We believe this can only be achieved with a tool that is simple enough for any American to use in a medium that is available to as many Americans as possible.&nbsp; Any American who has access to the internet, a computer or mobile phone can use the PushBI Recovery Tool.</p>
<p>Providing the PushBI Recovery Tool on the desktops and mobile phones of every American will provide the kind of transparency the government wants to provide and will be easily consumable by the American people.&nbsp; Every American can be involved helping our great nation in this time of need.</p>
<p>To get the idea&nbsp;for this tool go to <a href="http://pushbi.com/">http://pushbi.com/</a>&nbsp;and download the tool from the home page.&nbsp; It takes just a couple of minutes.</p>

<p><strong>The PushBI would be a great idea for tech savy citizens but it would eliminate our older generation. Most of the older people only use cell phones for emergency basis and do not have the latest technology at their finger tips. It would be an even better idea if agencies were responsible to sent that information out each month with people billing statements. This would save the government time and money. If you really want to make it known to all start a recovery newspaper and make it free to all Americans. This paper does not have to come out once a month. It could come out every three months. Make the first year free and afterwards charge $.50 - $1.00 per paper. This will allow money to go back into the economy and keep people up dated with current information.</strong></p>

<p>I don't think that this issue will be a one-idea-over-all kind of solution.&nbsp; But, I agree with the paper for the older generation.&nbsp; Or the information could be aired on the local news every quarter, too.&nbsp; Another idea would be to flash an ad for the site on those new billboard-TV's for greater exposure.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Show correlation between appropriations and results
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Transparency is a good thing and the efforts of everyone
trying to provide better visibility into the appropriation, obligation, and
spending of ARRA stimulus funds across the country should be applauded.&nbsp; But this gives us only half of the picture. What
is missing is a good way to show the correlation between the funding that was
spent and the results that were both expected and actually achieved. For
example, if money appropriated to HUD is supposed to reduce foreclosures, or
money for the Department of Transportation is supposed to decrease the
unemployment rate… then as taxpayers we have the right to see whether or not
that’s working.</p>
<p>A major requirement of getting an ARRA appropriation and
then spending that money should be to establish reasonable and measurable
expectations. For example, if reducing foreclosures is the goal, any organization
receiving funding for that purpose should have to specify how much of a
reduction is expected over specific periods of time and in what geographic
areas. Then reporting standards must be established to collect the data that
will enable everyone to see whether or not the goals are being met. Throughout
this process, it is essential to accurately correlate spending and expectations
with results in order to determine if goals achieved were actually due to the
ARRA funding or just a coincidence.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Correlating results with funding will enable all taxpayers
to clearly see if the way the government is spending our money is working or
not. It will help the government make better decisions about how to make future
appropriations. Throughout this stimulus cycle we have the opportunity to see
what’s not working and to try something different that is working.&nbsp;&nbsp; If appropriating funding for homeowners at
risk for foreclosure in high unemployment areas doesn’t change the foreclosure
rate, then that type of funding shouldn’t be appropriated.</p>
<p>Today we’re still using stimulus models based on what worked
or didn’t work during the Great Depression.&nbsp;
70 year old data is not a good model for today’s fast-paced
economy.&nbsp; By using modern technology to
report up-to-date facts to all of us and our elected representatives, we’ll be
providing a good base for making stimulus decisions in the near-term and we’ll
be developing a model that can be used for the next recession be it 5 years
from now or 50. It will also give voters a much better way of making
politicians and the government accountable for their promises.</p>

<p>I couldn't agree more with the taxpayer wanting to see clear, concise and accurate results, i.e., expectations for dollars spent.&nbsp; However, historically the government has a hard time defining what it expects and therefore the results are always subject to interpretation of how successful the task has been performed or if the money was wasted.&nbsp; A few clearly defined "expectations" is better that dozens of nice to see results from dollars spent is what the taxpayer wants to see.&nbsp; This may contradict what a government manager wants to see in the final analysis.&nbsp; Who is going to keep score?</p>

<p>Who will keep score?

Responsible citizens and the media.

This whole program has a chance to address the problem you point out...

Namely that legislation is often poorly defined as to results or expectations, the regulations and rules derived continue the sin of expectation omission and field operations and reporting do not address upon the unknown expectations. 

That is nonsense and needs to stop. 

Can you imagine Bill Gates (sorry Bill, but you are a such a great example) accepting the fact that an operating unit did not know what was expected of it and went merrily on its way spending money with no idea why? I wouldn't want to be in the same state when he found out.

Why should we, as responsible citizens, allow our local, state or federal government to do so?

We shouldn't and I heartily applaud the current administration for recognizing the need to allow the citizens of this country, the government's board of directors if you will, albeit huge and unwieldy, to do our jobs. While many will abdicate their responsibility, enough will not to insure efficient and effective government programs will be a more common occurrence.</p>

<p>Since it is our money that is being spent, as taxpayers we have the right to demand that it is spent responsibly. Every well-run business makes investments only after setting expectations about results. If results don't measure up to expectations, then they learn from their mistakes and don't invest money that same way any more. Why shouldn't government be held to the same standard or higher, especially since it is our money that they are spending?</p>

<p>I would go another step further than this idea and the comments&nbsp;made on it. I am all for getting value for money, whoever would not? I must add an observation though to open up new angles on the use of such information.</p>

<p>Other than the crazy font markup, I think this is a great idea.&nbsp; We need to be able to go beyond just tracking money to better understand what value is being delivered for those funds, and how effectively it is being delivered.</p>

<h1>
				Implement a "Trusted Information" Strategy
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Design a system that is based on a standadized data model and utilize data normalization tools and processes to ensure that received information can be trusted as accurate and authentic.&nbsp; When receiving data from so many different sources it is imperative that the data be accurate so that the business and performance management analytics that are expected to be produced can be relied upon for accuracy.&nbsp; In order to reach this objective it is essential that a standard data model, including data fields in an XML schema, be parsed to ensure that the data formats are consistent and reliable.&nbsp; This requires not only that a specification be published but that tools to detect data that is not compliant with the data model specifications can be automatically corrected to meet the needs of the solution.&nbsp; This goal can be realized by adopting the appropriate strategy, definition, governance, roadmaps and information infrastructure.&nbsp; Models for this concept can be found at <em><strong><a class="external-link" href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/information-agenda/">"The New Information Agenda"</a></strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Establishing this foundation will enable not only performance evaluations but will permit the assessment of the collected information for other purposes such as fraud and abuse detection and risk mitigation.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The foundation of a complex system that collects and aggregates massive amounts of data with the intention of using that source data for very significant performance evaluations such as those called for in the reconciliation aspect of the ARRA needs to ensure that the data received is consistent and reliable.</p>

<p>On October 10, the media is going to swarm Recovery.gov to test the ease of assessibility, and check the accuracy of the information.&nbsp; Reporting is one thing, but the accuracy of the information -- can it be trusted -- is another thing entirely, and is bigger than a bread box.&nbsp; Since the Obama administration has made transparency and accountabiulity the centerpiece of its new approach to Gov't, the very success of the Recover Act rests on the credibility of the results reported.&nbsp; If we turn on Recovery.gov and the mdeia and public find that the info is innacurate, and/or does not tie back in a consistent way to what is being reported elsewhere in the ecosystem -- that credibility is gone.</p>

<p>So how do you get to "Trusted Information" -- As one of the comments points out below, a good place to start is by developing a common vocabulary and semantics to describe how we define the different data elements.&nbsp; What constitutes a job?&nbsp; How is a job define?&nbsp; How is an investment progrma defined?&nbsp; are these definitions conistent across the Federal ecosystem, and even down to a State level, since state agencies will ultimately need to report as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; These definitions define the meata data that can then be used in a standardized data model.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree with the concept proposed here.&nbsp; The participants in this program, at all levels, need to ensure that the data they are capturing and passing up or down for reporting needs to be managed by a process that ensures that the data is highly accurate and can be totally trusted.&nbsp; I understand that there are a number of technologies that are designed to help ensure that the data is captured according to the expected specifications.&nbsp; Call it data quality assurrance or data cleansing.&nbsp; Either way that sort of process will lead to data that you can trust.</p>

				Make public data available to the public with web services
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Mandate that&nbsp;local, state and federal government agencies&nbsp;make their public information available in open format like XML, on rest or soap based web services.&nbsp; This would then empower both public and private developers and analysts to utilize this information in 'data fusion" centers where it can be visualized and analyzed&nbsp;with both spatial (GIS based tools) and non-spatial tools.&nbsp; A great example of this kind of "data fusion" or mashup application is Philadelphia's Neighborhood Information Center at <a href="http://www.cml.upenn.edu/nis/nBase.htm">http://www.cml.upenn.edu/nis/nBase.htm</a></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This is important at it exposes silo'd data kept in disparate systems and leverages available technology to turn vast amounts of data into usable information for both&nbsp;citizens and governments alike.&nbsp;</p>

				Data Mantates should focus on the WHAT's not HOW's
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Had this idea while resopnding to another idea;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a growing tendency for people to focus on phrases or ideas like make data available via "SOAP, or XML formats".</p>
<p>What should really happen is less a focus on _HOW_ data is delivered
(although that's an important followup) and for politicians and data savvy people
to talk about _WHAT_ is delivered.</p>
<p>e.g. I want to see a spec that says "Every gov. entity at a
department accounting level needs to show year-to-year operating costs,
total headcount, and break out spending for services (internal vs.
eternal) and operation costs (energy, fleet and fuel)"</p>
<p>Something like that with probably more detail like "calculate these
numbers with such-and-such methodology and you must also report the
Standard Deviation".</p>
<p>The "HOW" should be a small footnote, e.g.</p>
<p>"This data should be made available 16+ hrs a day including the hours of 9-5, 7 days a week via multiple formats including but not limited to XML and JSON"</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Going forward consistency on the metrics seems more important then consistency in the format. Computers and programmers are great at munging data that's available in many formats.</p>
<p>However, if one department spending # is calculated differently then another department's, then no amount of WSDL, SOAP, XML or JSON will help.</p>

<p>What your describing pertains to a specification and 'standards' definitions. I also agree that this governement standards specification will not happen overnight and will mature over time. This is a long process but based on other IT standards, well worth the effort. You should really discuss this with the existing standards groups that have years of experience on not only establishing and creating a standard but also how these standards and their committees should be run.</p>

<h1>
				Terms, Terminology, Existing Government Controls, Management Life Cycle
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>1. While the recovery act is understood by some, it needs more clarity in its terms.</p>
<p>The following terms need to be clearly defined on the Recovery.gov site.&nbsp; These terms need a very simple 6th grade-level definition, a high-school-level definition, and a technical or college-level definition, each with examples or descriptions to ensure that the diverse audience has a shared understanding of the ARRA intent and mechanisms.</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Recovery</li><li>Reinvestment</li><li>Transparency</li><li>Accountability</li><li>Openness</li><li>Strategic</li><li>Oversight</li><li>private sector</li><li>public sector</li><li>fraud</li><li>waste</li><li>abuse</li><li>mismanagement</li></ul>
<p>The terms fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement need to be especially well defined, as well as why the ARRA is seeking to prevent them by taking actions to ensure that their opposite behaviors (antonyms) take place within the ARRA implementation, tracking, and reporting.&nbsp; See the table below.</p>
<table class="MsoNormalTable">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Office of Inspector General: report allegations of fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement of federal funds.</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Antonyms</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Fraud (n): swindle; deceit; cheating; forgery; embezzlement; cheat, swindler</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Opposite of Fraud = Honesty, Openness, Tranparency</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Waste (v): squander, misspend, misemploy; throw away; destroy, spoil; weaken, impoverish; consume; dwindle away; wither;</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Opposite of Waste = Conserve, Sustain, Discipline</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Abuse (n): misuse; maltreatment; corrupt practice; foul language.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Opposite of Abuse = Best Practice, Good Use, Accountability</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Mismanagement: 1. management that is careless or inefficient; "he accomplished little due to the mismanagement of his energies"; (synonym) misdirection;&nbsp; (hyponym) screwup; (derivation) mismanage, mishandle, misconduct</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Opposite of Mismanagement = Management comprises directing and controlling a group of one or more people or entities for the purpose of coordinating and harmonizing that group towards accomplishing a goal. Management often encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources, and natural resources. (See Wikipedia)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Due to the multiple areas of crisis facing our country and the world, we need (across all aspects of the ARRA as well as across all aspects of our Governments, Commercial Organizations, Non-Profit Organizations,, Volunteer Organizations, diverse groups, and individuals) a means to keep our terms clearly defined, understood and consistently applied.&nbsp; We need a "National Recovery, Capabilities, Operations, and Governance Terminology" (See Wikipedia for explanation of Terminology).&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many open-source and commercial technologies and approaches that can built various terminologies having different capabilities.&nbsp; However, this suggested National Terminology more than simple lexicons, glossaries, and dictionaries.&nbsp; A terminology is a rich, meaning-focused, structured arrangement of terms, their meanings, and how they relate to each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A terminology, when well-developed and shared, provides a means to translate the jargon that often makes it difficult for one person, group, or organization to accurately communicate with another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A terminology can enable all participants in an effort to know and validate each other’s meaning, understand and operate well with shared processes and rules, and understand the data and information from the effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terminology is an implementation of "semantics".&nbsp; I suggest we use a public domain approach like that at <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/one-world-is.org/gem-ema/Home/gem-approach/gem-metamodel"><u>http://sites.google.com/a/one-world-is.org/gem-ema/Home/gem-approach/gem-metamodel</u></a> as a starting method for developing this shared National Terminology to enable better, faster, and cheaper capabilities, operations, and governance across the country.</p>
<p>2. There also needs to be communication about previous U.S. Government actions to reduce Fraud, Waste, Abuse, and Mismanagement within the Federal Government and by those who receive Federal funds.&nbsp; This is the same reason that the Recovery Accountability and Transparency (RAT) Board is comprised of Inspectors General (IG).</p>
<p><strong>Federal Laws Established to combat fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. Public Law&nbsp; = P.L., Executive Order = E.O., Title and Code = Rules</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.L. 95-452, the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended [Title 5 United States Code (U.S.C.), App. 3], which sets forth authority and functions of the Inspector General.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.L. 101-12, Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, which strengthens the protection available to Federal employees against prohibited personnel practices.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1010, Conduct of Employees, which requires an employee to report fraud, waste, abuse, and corruption in Federal programs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Title 18 U.S.C., Crimes and Criminal Procedures, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which prescribes rules that govern all criminal procedures in the Federal courts of the United States.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.O. 12731, “Principles of Ethical Conduct for Government Officers and Employees,” dated 10-17-90, which establishes the requirement for Government employees to disclose fraud, waste, abuse, and corruption.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.L. 110-409, Inspector General Reform Act of 2008</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.L. 111-5, February 17, 2009.American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act)</p>
<p class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The standing organization by which IG's across the government collaborate is the <strong>Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE). (see <a href="http://www.ignet.gov/"><u>http://www.ignet.gov</u></a>)&nbsp; Quoted from that site: </strong></p>
<p>"In October 2008, the President’s Counsel on Integrity and Efficiency previously established under Executive Order was abolished and replaced by provisions of the Inspector General Reform Act (Act). The Act established a new entity, the <strong>Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE)</strong>, which is an interagency council headed by a Chairperson, an Inspector General and an Executive Chairperson, the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The CIGIE is composed of presidentially and agency-head appointed Inspectors General, respectively, with a mission to address integrity, economy and effectiveness issues that transcend individual government agencies and to increase the professionalism and effectiveness of personnel by developing policies, standards, and approaches to aid in the establishment of a well trained and highly skilled workforce in the Offices of the Inspector General.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Functions and Duties of the Council include:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Continually identify, review, and discuss areas of weakness and vulnerability in Federal programs and operations with respect to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement; </li><li>Develop plans for coordinated, government-wide activities that address fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement and promote economy and efficiency in Federal programs and operations. These plans include interagency and inter-entity audit, investigations and evaluation programs and projects to deal efficiently and effectively with those problems concerning fraud and waste that exceed the capability or jurisdiction of an individual agency; </li><li>Develop policies that will aid in the maintenance of a corps of well-trained and highly skilled OIG personnel; </li><li>Maintain one or more training academies for the professional training of auditors, investigators, inspectors, evaluators, and other OIG personnel; </li><li>Submit recommendations of individuals to the appropriate appointing authority to fill Inspector General vacancies, and </li><li>Maintain an Integrity Committee to receive, review and refer for investigation allegations of wrongdoing that are made against Inspectors General and staff members. </li></ul>
<p>All of these responsibilities to prevent mismanagement, and thus reduce the likelihood of abuse or waste of Federal resources, or fraud involving Federal Resources, exist for all Federal activities, including the new ARRA.&nbsp; This needs to be emphasized, especially the role that the current administration's drive towards "transparency" in making this long standing requirement for stewards' accountability more visible to those who own the resources under their stewardship.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; National Management Methodology is needed.</p>
<p>The "Rational Thought Process" described by Norman V. Peale is paraphrased as: "knowing where you are, knowing where you want to go, and knowing how to get there".&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Path = interdependent transition plans.&nbsp; </li><li>Destination = To-Be state.&nbsp; </li><li>Starting Point = As-Is state.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>You don't necessarily need to know much detail about the starting point - you do need to know enough about what needs to change (i.e., gap, deficiency, shortcoming, overlap awareness).&nbsp; Customers are the best sources of this information, i.e., customers of each outward-facing value-chain and each internal value-stream.</p>
<p>I use the following simplified definition of "management": resolving natural and continuous disorder into intended order.&nbsp; Another way of expressing what management consists of is:&nbsp; knowing your Current (As-Is) state, knowing your intended (To-Be) state, and building, implementing, and adjusting transition plans to achieve your intended state by intentionally changing your current state.&nbsp; Wikipedia's definition elaborates on this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any management repository (e.g., an extension of an enterprise architecture (EA) repository), must have a metamodel that can capture the steps and details of the management life cycle methodology followed by the organization and its participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is no cohesive, coherent, and consistent management life cycle methodology applied by the organization and all of its parts, then the organization is operating in a non-rational, fragmented/partial/compartmented, wandering, impulsive, non-ordered manner.&nbsp; This sounds like insanity as a worst case, or aggressively acting in ignorance as a best case!&nbsp; Since educated management knows this, acting without a common management life cycle approach is mismanagement in any case, which opens up increased probability of waste, abuse, and fraud in every case.</p>
<p>So, if you don't have continuously refreshed knowledge, through a shared terminology, of your current As-Is state, haven’t specified and continually updated your To-Be state, and continually created, refined, and priority-sorted your plans to transition from As-Is to ToBe states, then any changes being pursued are wild, uncontrolled, lunges by leaders and managers towards shiny new things - i.e., the absence of management, i.e., mismanagement.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>If we don't have a common terminology (terms, definitions, concept maps, taxonomy, thesaurus, ontology, axiology) then we very likely to not understand each other, and very likely to hide information, thereby making mismanagement likely, thereby making waste, abuse, and fraud more likely.</p>
<p>We all need to recognize that the ARRA is giving increase transparency over long-standing law, orders, and rules that apply management controls to all Federal efforts and resources, including those funded through the ARRA.&nbsp; Inspector Generals in all Federal Agencies and their other government, commercial, and non-profit counterparts, have clearly defined and long-standing responsibilities for ensuring adequate control of Federal Resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organization Owners/Citizens/Investors, Boards/Legislatures, Executives, Managers, and Workforce all have responsibilities to establish and comply with those controls.&nbsp; Positions that have the duty and authority to look across all elements of an Organization's staff and subordinate organizations (e.g., Chiefs of Staff, Deputies for Administration) are typically those most likely to ensure controls exist and are enforced, and therefore would pass the scrutiny of the IGs and auditors</p>

<p>I particularly like the common sense clarity of the last comment.&nbsp; Roy has hit on the fact that terminology is&nbsp; fundamental to enhancing shared understanding and collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be helpful to have&nbsp;a simple set of shared language to discuss recovery concepts.&nbsp; If this set is kept small, it should be an easy addition to recovery.gov.&nbsp; The broader terminology activity seems to me to be an effort in its own right that could be facilitated by a WIKI like wikipedia, or better a semantic wiki that also allows semantics to be defined between terms.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				National Web site Security, Compliance, and Accreditation service
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>My vision is that the federal government would provide a SaaS based solution that would automate the process of becoming a secure provider of Web Services or Web Applications.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Service would provide a self registration for federal agencies, state and local, and other government entities allowing the web administrators the ability to produce a compliance report for their web site or service.&nbsp; This service would scan their applications for malware, vulnerabilities, standard IA best practices, audit for compliance measures like Privacy impact assessments, section 508, and site quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once registered the users can use the site on a periodic basis to reassess their level of compliance as well as leverage the services documentation, policy, and best practices as guidelines to bring the same testing standards in house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a clean assessment is complete the users of the service can download a seal of approval or certificate stating they completed the federal compliance audit using the service.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the service lives on vulnerability checks will be updated with the latest risks and policies, IA guidelines can be matured to meet the most recent assessment criteria and the users of the service can re-assess their applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>More and more our own federal websites are contributing to the global spread of malware, spyware and other types of computer based threats to our national security.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are immediately attributed to theft of identities, consumer data, corporate theft, and classified content.&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to take immediate action to address these issues with education, enablement, and technology with a strong commitment to improving the governmental web that we rely on more and more every day.</p>
<p>Current practices like FISMA can be dramatically more effective with the assistance of automated testing and assessment tools like the service I have described.&nbsp;&nbsp; Making what was once a paper pushing exercise, a dynamic integrated part of the application life cycle.</p>
<p>For more information on IBM technologies that can support the process stated above please see <a class="external-link" href="http://www.ibm.com/federal/security">http://IBM.com/federal/security</a> or follow my twitter ID at <a class="external-link" href="http://www.twitter.com/IBMFedCyber">http://twitter.com/IBMFedCyber</a></p>

<p>Not trying to start a flame war but this is not a sales pitch.&nbsp; I would be happy to see a service like this as a tax payer.&nbsp;&nbsp; We waste so much on paper pushing processes that provide little in terms of real advancement. &nbsp; Too many agencies are unaware of (or lack bandwidth to deal with) the threats they face when they interact with citizens on the web.&nbsp;&nbsp;The educational value of a service like this would also far outweigh the initial investment.&nbsp; Additionally, this service could provide data and visibility that can be used to improve our overall security strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp; Any tools that can address this issue are a positive in fighting online crime that costs our government countless amounts of money and puts our national security in jeopardy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Any IT solution must ensure the privacy and security of data.&nbsp; This is what consumers expect and what our government promises. Because numerous federal and state laws require government to maintain both the confidentiality and the protection of certain data, any IT solution for Recovery.gov must be "government ready" by these criteria.&nbsp; Ensuring the privacy and security of data will increase consumer confidence and trust in the way data is handled by government and non-government actors alike.&nbsp; We cannot gamble public trust on IT solutions that have an&nbsp; open door to bad actors.</p>

<p>There are laws and regs on the Federal and State/Local levels related to protecting the privacy of a individual's and groups' info/data and the penalties for breach(s).&nbsp; However, how "well known" are these regs to the general public and the "bad guys," and organizations?&nbsp; Besides, it seems that the bad guys and others get away "more" than what they can get punish for their crimes!&nbsp; There's not a great deal of understanding of the seriousness of these crime!&nbsp; E.g., personal info&nbsp;is relatively easy to get and/or buy form many commercial sources.&nbsp; And, many times, the sold info were not up-dated or wrong.&nbsp; But, no one cares!

<p>This is a very important point.&nbsp; It is also important to note that government agencies have their own rules around privacy and security as it pertains to handling sensitive data.&nbsp; Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid come to mind not to mention military or FBI classified information.&nbsp; Any solution must also be government ready by agency criteria as well.</p>

<p>Having strong data protections&nbsp;in&nbsp;place&nbsp;and a clear privacy policy are critical to the success of any project using government data.&nbsp; That includes a users right to “browse” hosted government data in private and should prevent user behavior from ever being shared with a third party.&nbsp; Getting these ground rules right early in the process will build trust and success.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Use semantic technology to link data.gov and recovery.gov resources
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Use semantic web technologies to expose metadata and structure of information to link data on recovery.gov with information shared through data.gov.&nbsp;<br /><br />The first level win is to accelerate the process of providing raw data, via a RSS feed. This implies a restful API plus providing definition of the data elements and structure so that people know what they are getting. Semantic web technologies are preferable to XML and microformats for this because they are designed to share and expose definitions of tags as well as data, and to map different sets of tags (i.e., schemas or ontologies) with eachother<br /><br />The second level win is to provide a solution for <strong>semantic publishing</strong> of information (e.g. data, text, tables, graphics, imagery) tagged and linked for both human and machine interpretation. For example, the Statistical Abstract is a report, well curated, and with a lot of data tables, etc. and also, well thought out metadata, and statistical methodologies about how the data are derived, etc. Making information in recovery.gov and data.gov available for both human and machine processing / interpretation implies being able to expose the concepts and structure of the different kinds of information linked to an underlying ontology. First step might be to post the content in a web 2.0 wiki and upload documents and data sets for downloading. The next step would be to expose the structure / semantics of this information using semantic web technologies. Plus, it is always wise to engage the people who publish the information to help with the modeling. All doable today.<br /><br />—<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>The third level win is to use semantic metadata and modeling to facilitate data mash-up of different information from different sources:<br /><br />(a) In some cases this is relatively easy to do with web 2.0 techniques. Someone accesses a couple of RSS feeds, and combines these with other data and web services. The mash-up maker resolves any semantic issues as part of creating the mash-up.<br /><br />(b) In other cases, a new use of information can take advantage of the curation and semantic data linkages that some agency, or other party has already provided and expressed as ontology, making it possible to establish user interface features that allow for do-it-yourself exploration and conversations with data.<br /><br />(c) In still other cases, the alignment of concepts and resolution of intents, definitional and methodological issues across data will require additional effort.<br /><br />Obviously, you go for the low hanging fruit first.</span></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>We are moving into an era where we will expect to access and interrelate all information in the internet information by concepts, not just by artifacts and hard coded structures. While it is possible to use XML syntax to identify concepts in hierarchies, assuming we all use the same tags in the same way, this is not adequate for representing and reasoning over the diversity of structured data, documents, and web content. Simple solutions are great. But, we also need an approach that can scale, handle complexity, and can adapt and evolve easily as needs change. Semantic web technology provides a better choice for this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like where this is going, but worry that the use cases for the data are not well understood.&nbsp; the more data that is put out for consumption, the more the need for adjudication and reconciliation of overlapping data where the majority of time the main differentiator is which agency published it.&nbsp; With all the overlap in government programs, its very hard for the bureacracy to make sense of each other's data.&nbsp; Asking the citizen, business community, or watch dogs to do so is very risky.&nbsp; As i have maintained for 9 years, we need to simplify and unify the data, or at least rationalize it as we make it available to the public.&nbsp; Also, we need to filter the bad data out of our systems.&nbsp; Semantics should help that a lot.</p>

				Gov. buildings should report their energy usage and track savings

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>If we're going to invest in Greening America then we should start (as the Gov has said) with America's Administration itself.</p>
<p>Green cars and green technology are an important part of our future success as a nation and I believe tracking and reporting that savings will ensure the type of transparency we need.</p>
<p>Every building that receives Goverment Reinvestment and Recovery funding for "greening" should be required to accurately report the savings that investment has made.</p>
<p>This reporting should be done by automated sensors and accounting methods, the type that man businesses are looking to develop and companies want to utilize to create our "smart grid".</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>It not only privodes a ready made "proving ground" for innovation and funds adoption and development but it serves to prove that an investment was worthwhile and not wasted.</p>

<h1>
				Amazon Public Datasets. Credits  for EC2
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Host on
Amazon as Public Datasets. Grant Amazon Credits to Developers and Organization
for EC2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By making
the dataset available as an Amazon public dataset, many Developers and Organizations
will easily be able work with the changing data without the need</p>
<p>to download
and configure the latest available information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;(see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/">http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/</a>
)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By granting
EC2 credits based on merit, (i.e. sharing of the analytics of the raw data made
available as public datasets) Individuals and Organizations using and sharing the
data in the most meaningful ways will be
supported encouraging greater participation and re-use of information .</p>
<p> (For more on EC2, see &nbsp;<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the recent
release of Elastic MapReduce, data-intensive tasks for applications can
be easily implemented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/">http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/</a>
)</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Many good
ideas of how to process the information to be made available are likely to be
presented, but supporting the Individuals and Organizations in this endeavor is
perhaps the most important aspect. Thus the need for EC2 credits and public datasets</p>

<p>With large datasets does come limited accessibility. The average person who wants to be invovled is forced to buy large hardrives, servers, etc. Most people balk at spending hundreds of dollars on a hobby or wim, so they don't participate.&nbsp; With all the stimulus money, some small&nbsp;subsidies&nbsp;should be made available for resources to process the large amounts of data.&nbsp; Amazon makes this easy, but it doesn't have to be hosted by them.</p>

<h1>
				Accessibility to Data Generated by Recovery.gov
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>All information should be readily accessible for everyone, including
people with disabilities. Adherence to accessibility standards defined
in <a title="Section 508" href="http://section508.gov/">Section 508</a> and the <a title="Web Accessibility Initiative" href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative</a>
(WAI) should be considered opportunities, not impediments to presenting
data on Recovery.gov. For example, adding closed captioning/timed
transcripts to video allows all viewers to search based on text. Also,
adding XSL to raw data allows a wider audience to read and understand
information that would normally be avoided. Many of the same techniques
that make a site more accessible to assistive technology used by people
with disabilities also make the information more machine processable.
Just by following open standards like using valid XHTML will help avoid
missteps and aggravation in making content accessible. And, although
not a technical issue, please use simple and direct language in public
documents.<br />
While the current Recovery.gov site presents accessibility barriers and
does not follow the standards it claims to follow such as XHTML, the
National Dialogue site is much closer to the goal of being accessible.
To help with making the Recovery.gov site more usable and valuable, we
recommend the following steps:</p>
<ol><li>Abide by open and accessibility standards starting in the
design phase through completion. Define the standard used (we recommend
WCAG 2.0 AA).<br />
</li><li>Provide human readable documentation when practicable to explain all posted data.<br />
</li><li>Use authoring tools when practicable that enforce standards and accessibility.</li><li>Audit all content that is made public to ensure that it is accessible.</li><li>Include a representation in all distributed and published material
that it is accessible, preferably with an active link to test the
representation so viewers can easily test for themselves.</li></ol>
<p>
Also there are some lightweight standards that will help with the
public's ability to comment on and reuse content presented on
Recovery.gov and Data.gov.</p>
<ul><li>Use simple web addresses for each and every page, including pages with raw data (see <a id="n8nr" title="Cool URL's" href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URL's</a>
and avoid using "?q=content" in the site's URLs). This will allow the
public to more easily cite Recovery.gov information in their own web
sites, blogs and communications. In long documents, use anchor tags.<br />
</li><li>Avoid iframes.</li><li>Like Wikipedia, use simple XHTML with "id" and "class" attributes
that will help avoid CSS problems and make the content more machine
accessible.</li><li>When possible, avoid locking up text in graphics and depending on
alt tags. Note that downloadable fonts are now possible in most
browsers with graceful degradation to standard fonts for other browsers
(see <a title="CSS font-face" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-webfonts/#font-descriptions">CSS font-face</a>).</li><li>Always link to referenced laws, regulations and other government sites as practicable. <br />
</li><li>Be especially careful when creating a public dialogue to avoid
technologies that are inaccessible. Dialogues that take place in real
time are more difficult and should require extra care. Consider
allowing the public to self publish their own comments with embedded
links to the relevant part of the Recovery Act and/or Recovery.gov site
(see <a title="OPIA" href="http://opendialogcoalition.org/">OPIA</a> ).</li></ul>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Making information accessible should be considered a great opportunity for Recovery.gov.<br />

<p>Having worked on content accessibility on many federal and federally-funded properties I have had the unadulterated joy of trying to make contentual properties that conform to the spirit of the law (WCAG WAI) and the letter of the law (Section 508). It is my opinion that content accessibility starts with the author, the publishing of content to the Web is the last step in a very long process. All federally-funded sites are already required to comply with Section 508, for better or for worse, and therefore what we should be asking for is more accountability for those who do not comply with the law. Separately, it may be a useful conversation to consider adopting international standards from the W3C instead of the current portions of 508 that can, in my experience, impede the accessibility of content.</p>

<p>This is an ultra-important topic. The U.S.G. needs at least one model of best practice to inspire other website's as well as the so many (billions) of public and private website's that could use a makeover. This is a great educational moment for all citizens and organizations to learn about web publishing. And each of the fixes for accessibility has a rationale that applies to everybody, thinking of the "curb cut" principle.&nbsp; This dialog is off to a great start.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Use freely available internatinoal information standards (such as XBRL) to streamline IT infrastructures, improve data quality, enhance analytical and visualization capabilities and process agility while reducing overall system costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are 3 examples of where this is occuring now:</p>
<p>- Australia SBR Project - multiple agencies collaborating to reduce compliance costs 25%:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.sbr.gov.au/content/default.htm">http://www.sbr.gov.au/content/default.htm</a></p>
<p>- Dutch Taxonomy Project - multiple agencies collaborating to reduce compliance costs 25%:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.xbrl-ntp.nl/english">http://www.xbrl-ntp.nl/english</a></p>
<p>- Nevada SBR Project - state level agencies collaborating to reduce compliance costs:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.govtech.com/gt/653427">http://www.govtech.com/gt/653427</a></p>
<p>There are many other examples available at either <a href="http://www.xbrl.org">http://www.xbrl.org</a> or <a href="http://www.xbrl.us">http://www.xbrl.us</a>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Proven track record in reducing compliance costs (for governmental agencies and regulated constituents) while enhancing analytical capabilities and process agility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The XBRL standard is useful for the ENTIRE supply chain, not only external reporting/compliance but also within ledger and sub-ledger (transaction) systems.&nbsp; The application within agency reporting structures would allow for disparate agencies to more cost effectively share, consolidate, manage and report on information relevant to decision making.&nbsp;</p>

Mike,
<p>The XBRL standard is not only a great idea for a project of this magnitude, the assumption should be that it would be mandated.&nbsp; As mentioned in the thread on <a class="external-link" href="../provide-enterprise-resource-planning-solutions-to-local-agencies">Rebuilding Management</a>, complete transparency with this project is tantamount to success since the major consumable is labor and as we all know, labor is typically where fraud is introduced.&nbsp; I agree completely with your assessment on adopting the <a class="external-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBRL">XBRL standard</a>.</p>

<p>Between OMB, GAO,&nbsp;Congress, existing statutes and regulations at the national, state, and local levels, and taxpayer and other demands, there's a highly diverse appetite for types of information about the use of taxpayer money and debt proceeds. Because XBRL-tagged data is easily (and should be automatically) tagged at the transaction level,&nbsp;the standard&nbsp;can be the touchstone that changes the game when it comes to creating a truly&nbsp;standard format for private and government business alike.</p>

<p>XBRL tagging would revolutionize auditing of the use of tax and debt revenue. Most government corruption involves people "playing the seams" between government spending or revenue and the private sector.

<p>XBRL provides the standard for the tagging of information, enabling
the effective and efficient provision of business information to and
from users. In our particular situation, XBRL (with the appropriate
taxonomy) would allow the tracking and monitoring of information
provided through the grants process, from central government
appropriation, to end program use, and reporting of such use all the
way back up through the reporting chain. XBRL will also allow and
support reporting at any level of that process, and provide easy to use
reporting to citizens interested in the effectiveness of allocation and
spending of government fund.</p>

<p>Mike, you point out quite correctly that international
implementations are or are expected to deliver efficiency improvements
of around 25% for business reporting to governments. These improvements
will also be available where government is both the reporting entity
and the consumer and user of the information. In addition, existing
XBRL rendering technology such as that provided by the SEC,
demonstrates the capability for XBRL to deliver such reporting
simplicity to individuals interested in seeing just how their tax
dollars are being used.</p>

<h1>
				Federal Performance Management Solution
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The ARRA guidance requires capture of performance milestones from the agencies (program plans) and requires that prime recipients of ARRA funds submit quarterly performance and spending reports. &nbsp;The solution could go a few steps further to morph into a Federal Performance Management Solution that stores all agency performance plan milestones, and requires that Federal agencies report how all contract and grant solicitations will help achieve the agency performance milestones. Then, when the awards of contracts and grants are made, the recipients of those contracts and grants can report progress that then can roll up to the agency's larger performance milestones. &nbsp;The end result would be performance reporting for all federal expenditures that would include all agencies, their performance milestones, how those milestones are supported by contracts and grants, and whether the recipients are performing in fulfillment of the agency milestones. &nbsp;This could easily be expended from ARRA related spending to all federal contracts and grant spending.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>A Federal Performance Management Solution would fully achieve the Administration's open government and transparency agenda from the perspective of spending accountability and performance traceability. &nbsp;This solution would extend the agenda originally articulated in FFATA to include full traceability back to agency performance milestones. &nbsp;This solution will benefit the public by showing how agency spending supports the larger agency milestones and how the recipients of contract and grant funds are acting in alignment with the agency strategy and milestones.</p>

<p>My fear here is that there are already rumblings that the current requirements for tracking are unduly cumbersome. And, any performance management system has to be cognizant of the administrative/operational burden of capturing the data. In my experience, capturing the data solely "to allow reporting and analysis" is a good way to get pretty lousy data. ARRA may be an exception, but we need to be really careful that this doesn't become a bloated bureaucracy requiring that a substantial percent of the funds get used on administrative work -- namely, capturing too much detailed data that may or may not ever be put to real use. I'm all for formalized performance measurement...but this one scares me with its ambition.</p>

<p>This can be achieved. &nbsp;Agencies currently publish their annual Performance Accountability Reports (PAR) as required by law which include end outcomes, intermediate outcomes, and measures. &nbsp;The PAR data should be linked to the contract and grant solicitation data so that when a contract or grant solicitation goes out the door it is linked to the relevant parts of the agency strategy as captured in the PAR. &nbsp;Basically a lot of this information is floating around, just not linked.</p>

<h1>
				Packaged Solution for Project Accountability and Transparency in 10 Days
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>ARRA's accelerated timeframes and extensive requirements are driving demand for solutions that get organizations up and running quickly. Packaged solutions which can provide a comprehensive framework for project control first - &nbsp;then transparency reporting and visibility; will become the most effective way of quickly implementing standardized, automated processes for complying with the reporting requirements of ARRA.</p>
<div>
<p>The idea is a solution with Software as a Service (SaaS), professional services and maintenance at a fixed price. The solution is designed to enable customers to meet ARRA accountability requirements within 10 days, and establish reporting for public transparency according to guidelines. The soilution combines best-in-class capital project and program management capabilities with integrated funding and grant management to provide agencies the ability to execute projects efficiently with visibility across all phases of the project lifecycle, and automate reporting with ARRA-compliant data feeds.</p>
<p>Skire (<a title="blocked::http://www.skire.com/" href="http://www.skire.com/"><u>www.skire.com</u></a>) is one such example of this and have a packaged solution which they recently announced called “RapidStart STARR” (Skire Transparency, Accountability, Recovery and Reinvestment). The solution in combination with their experience in capital project management and the collective knowledge of their public-sector customers, enables them to help ARRA recipient organizations accelerate their readiness, control and track their infrastructure projects, in order to more effectively capitalize on immediate funding opportunities.</p>
</div>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The heightened emphasis on accountability and transparency places a premium on readiness, streamlined execution and accuracy of information. Agencies receiving ARRA funds, or managing capital improvement and infrastructure projects, must report on fund use and can expect high levels of scrutiny on managing risk, controlling project cost and schedule,&nbsp;and making data available to the public. Organizations that are unable to meet this expectation and report the use of funds quickly, accurately and transparently will be left out of funding opportunities.</p>

<p>A number of organizations may think that they can bolt on a simple reporting solution to become compliant.&nbsp; Given that project control and comprehensive base information needs to be the foundation for any transparency reporting and more importantly accountability; this would appear to be a very attractive solution, not to mention the 10 day implementation schedule.</p>

<h1>
				Use of Business Process Management (BPM) Technology for Recovery Programs
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>At Oakbrook Solutions, we have teamed up with Appian Corporation out of Vienna, VA to leverage Enterprise Business Process Management (BPM)&nbsp;technology to provide process automation, management and accountability solutions for complex and changing processes in the Wealth and Investment Management Industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that the US Government has invested in economic recovery programs&nbsp;on behalf of the US taxpayer, we recommend a close look at properly applied BPM technology&nbsp;as a scalable platform that can provide the following:</p>
<ul><li>Rapid deployment of automated solutions to manage Economic Recovery Programs with no programming required (i.e. we built a prototype to manage the CPP application process using&nbsp;8 hours of a business analyst's time)</li><li>Ablity to tie together disparate data sources and organizational entities into a single integrated process</li><li>Complete visibility into the end-to-end process with full audit trail that drives process transparency and accountability.</li><li>Intuitive Workflow Design with integrated Business Rules architecture enables rapid deployment and facilitates ongoing change in a collaborative environment</li><li>Rich portal, content management, and user collaboration capabilites.&nbsp; Comprehensive drill-down dashboards created with no programming.&nbsp; Automated generation, storage, and version control of all documents associated a process.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<ul><li>The US Government needs a platform to enable rapid deployment and ongoing change of solutions to manage Economic Recovery programs.</li><li>The platform needs to enable process integration (both data integration and user&nbsp;interaction integration)&nbsp;among all organizational entities affiliated with a program.</li><li>The platform must enable complete process transparancy and accountability to satisfy ever changing requirements in a challenging economic and political environment.</li><li>Traditional&nbsp;software development efforts simply cannot keep up with the pace of change and deployment requirements mandated by&nbsp;these programs.</li></ul>
<p>BPM technology is built to provide these capabilities.&nbsp; Properly applied by financial services industry experts, a BPM-based solution would be an extremely effective and versatile platform that would serve as the&nbsp;backbone for the integrated automation, management, transparency, and compliance for&nbsp;the US Treasury's Economic Recovery programs.</p>

<p>The Federal Enterprise Architecture features a strategy to use service orientation to build out capabilities across the whole federal enterprise. The SOA strategy is articulated in the&nbsp;Practical Guide to Federal Service Oriented Architecture. Whether BPM is used or not the Federal government needs to follow its own guidance in developing any solutions or capabilities to support automation of reporting or communications whether it be in Recovery.gov or Data.gov. The use of SOA and SOA constructs with a searchable library of normalized service apps would be a good start and having a common notational support for such using BRMN or such might well be a good approach. The federal government needs to stop reinventing its approaches and constructs and use the ones it already has.</p>

<p>Both Gartner and Forrester have illustrated as best practice how BPM technology compliments and actually enables existing SOA architecture.&nbsp; SOA by itself results only in a disparate transactional integration capability.&nbsp; A business process requires a sequence of user interactions and transactions to be coordinated&nbsp;across the enterprise.&nbsp; This is being coined as the "Process Layer" within the organization, which is where BPM fits in.</p>

<p>Following the review of feed back on this and other "ideas" it appears evident that there is a tremendous investment both in people and systems that a great number of participants are naturally intent on growing and protecting.&nbsp; <strong>BPM transcends and enables current staff and technology investment while allowing access and transparency across all technology platforms</strong>.&nbsp; This is accomplished with very little programming and enables quick, change to take place in a very timely fashion. Further, BPM allows the user, who knows the processes and systems in use&nbsp;to&nbsp;actually&nbsp;be involved with the actual creation&nbsp;of the solution without heavy reliance upon IT.</p>

<h1>
				Lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina plus FFATA/status reports/sub-awards
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The ARRA legislation creates technical and business problems similar to Hurricane Katrina Recovery in Louisiana and Mississippi, and the lessons learned could serve the ARRA process very well. As was the case with Federal funds to support post-Katrina rebuilding efforts, promises are great, expectations are high, and timeline to deploy is extremely short. ARRA must meet a wide-range of challenges that include:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Lack of standard financial assistance reporting at all levels of government, </li><li>Rapid deployment,</li><li>Ability to handle large number of transactions,</li><li>Co-existence with a wide range of State stove-pipe systems, </li><li>Lack of standardized grant identifiers at the State level and even within State agencies themselves,</li><li>Collection of never before requested data, </li><li>Access to and security of assistance data, </li><li>Solution flexibility and responsiveness in light of expected changes and adjustments to the Federal ARRA guidance, and</li><li>Fraud prevention capabilities. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding how to effectively respond and properly manage expectations in a public and politically charged environment is, as the commercial says, priceless. For Hurricane Katrina Recovery, our product solution supported:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Rapid implementation: Production-ready three weeks after requirements finalized,</li><li>Scalability:&nbsp; Ability to meet wide range of transaction volumes -- In Louisiana alone, more applications were submitted in one day than in the busiest day of Grants.gov’s history supporting the entire Federal government,</li><li>Unique data collection requirements: Substantial and unique eligibility data,</li><li>Historical Tracking: Record of all data feeds into and out of the system,</li><li>Rapidly changing requirements: Constantly changing project requiring extensive flexibility and responsiveness, </li><li>Fraud prevention: No money provided until all data verified against sources (Insurance company payouts, FEMA payouts, National Flood Insurance Program payouts, SBA loans), and</li><li>High visibility and transparency: Weekly reports posted for public tracking.</li></ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Additional existing product functionality that could benefit the ARRA process includes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>End-to-end grants management processes</li><li>Collection of all FFATA data elements</li><li>Financial and status reporting </li><li>Notification, alerts and reminders</li><li>Sub-grant tracking and reporting</li><li>Grants.gov interface</li></ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Repositories are needed at the Federal level, as well as each State for their ARRA assistance and sub-award activities tracking within their state. Once the data is collected in a consistent and standardized format within the repository, validation interface requirements, governance, and other pieces can be incrementally added. STR would be glad to meet with the Recovery Board to discuss further. Contact STR.Grants Dean Moore, <a href="mailto:dmoore@strllc.com"><u>dmoore@strllc.com</u></a>.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The lessons learned, as well as investments made in people and tools would help lower the risk, and provide benefit to the process.</p>

<p>I agree with the similarities between ARRA and Katrina challenges, and lessons learned should be incorporated, especially regarding results within less then optimal timelines. This is very interesting, but clearly recovery.gov is about more then just collecting data. I thought FFATA was still waiting on a Federal pilot?</p>

<p>The problem at Katrina was not availability of funds or resources, There was plenty of help available. The majority of the the publicly visible problems stemmed from the abandonment of the ICS/NIMS system that our country's Emergency Management community had spent over 30 years developing. This system was bypassed at every level by State and Local politicians wanting media time and shouting at each other. The disgust for&nbsp; the folks wrangling and dodging blame on TV while people were living (or dying) in terrible conditions was immense. I'm not certain that this makes it a good test case for transparency and association with FFATA.</p>

Two items I believe will be key to success in the efforts to maintain accountability:
<p>1. Uniformity of data. Clear and straight-forward definitions of the data required that are published not only to the recipients but as part of the accountability and transparency tools such as the FFATA website will go a long way in this regard. State and local agencies are accustomed to having to meet specific data requirements when working with federal funds, the largest problem in this respect is usually determining the intent if the required data definitions out of the convoluted and obscure legalese that they are couched in. Clear, concise, human-language, definitions at all levels of reporting that are uniform will reduce confusion, provide for consistent communication and reduce "data translation" costs at all levels. This is especially true in that data compatibility will allow for "apples to apples" comparison rather than trying to reconcile totally different measures.</p>

<p>2. Clear rules. FFATA is a great idea for having us as citizens gain visibility to how funds are being used. However, those using the funds need to also have guidance in what is and is not acceptable use and what the consequences of unacceptable use will be. Those at the sharp end need to be able to use there judgment to allocate resources for best effect but also have clear definitions of what will not be acceptable so as to avoid it. Clear "ground rules" will promote best use of the funds and ease the difficulties created by too much complexity.</p>

<p>Another cost-savings on the administrative side would be secure electronic reporting through all levels. If such reporting is managed at the federal level then data uniformity is helped (not solved outright but helped, if application is consistent). Less "tail" and more "dog" is key to using this money wisely and that is the base expectation.</p>

<p>I don’t know if there is a plan for another FFATA sub-award pilot or not, there was a small pilot at the end of last calendar year. The reason for our mention of FFATA is because we have Federal clients in addition to State clients, and Federal granting agencies require the ability to capture FFATA data from their Prime grantees, and we have already incorporated the ability to collect, edit, and report on FFATA data into our solution. I also agree that data capture is only one part of the much larger recovery.gov overall solution requirement.</p>

				Proposed metamodel for Recovery Act accountability / transparency reporting
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>In response to Mr. Earl Devaney's request sent out via email this morning, I have attached a diagram showing, at a high level, a proposed metamodel for Recovery Act accountability and transparency reporting:</p>
<p><img class="image-inline image-inline" src="recovery.gov_metamodel.JPG/image_preview" alt="Recovery.gov metamodel" /></p>
<p>This is just a first draft, of course, but this model contains most (if not all) of the data elements needed to support creation / generation of all reports required by the law and OMB policy (OMB M-09-15), including the major communications reports, funding notification reports, and periodic financial reports.&nbsp; It also captures important performance metrics like job creation and per-state funding, and encapsulates the semantics needed to geo-encode the instances of stimulus spending.&nbsp; It is high-level enough that the data elements should map fairly cleanly to existing Federal financial management, grants management, procurement, and budget formulation data models.</p>
<p>I am currently working on an XML schema representation of this metamodel, and would be delighted to have further discussions with the Recovery Act Accountability and Transparency Board about the applicability of this model to Recovery.gov.</p>

<h1>
				Easy presentation of recovery.gov  data using semantic lenses.
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Rcovery.gov contains far more data than can be easily managed or understood by simply visiting the site. &nbsp;Semantic lens technology allows people to combine data of their choosing with widgets of their choosing to work with the data they need in the view they want. This type of capability will make the recovery.gov data much more useful to anyone who visits the site and make the achieving the desired transparency realistic.<br /><br />Visitors to recovery.gov should have the ability to easily create unlimited views of any data hosted on the Web site. With semantic lens technology they can. With semantic lens technologies related views are automatically found together with ways to link widgets together.&nbsp;People can create an endless variety of tables and charts, maps and mash-ups of recovery data as they see fit.&nbsp;Furthermore, these views can be saved for reuse and shared with other visitors to recovery.gov.</span></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Transparency does not exist if the data is rendered inaccessible by its format or sheer mass. &nbsp;We need an easy to use and combine set of widgets that allow recovery.gov data to combined and viewed by the average citizen. This will foster not only the feeling of transparency but transparency itself. &nbsp;By providing a flexible front end--a window into the mass of recovery spending data--transparency will move from being a distant goal to a very present reality.<br /></span></p>

<p>I agree with this need, and a certain level of user will find this very helpful.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; there is a larger group of users who will be looking for graphical displays (charts, graphic representations of the numbers, etc.).&nbsp; For those users, drill down capability embedded in charts and graphics is very helpful and intuitive.&nbsp; So for instance,&nbsp; if they click on a line on a chart it opens another window that expands to shows a graph of that particular piece of date.&nbsp; Drill downs could go all the way down to individual project, contractors or subcontractors.&nbsp; Having both types of data analysis and presentation available would reach a broad audience.</p>

<p>Both the semantic lens and drill down approaches call attention to the need for information to be readily visualized and navigated by diverse sets of users.&nbsp; I would add that these tools could be used for additional, and much broader, purposes - especially around the widespread cynicism and distrust of government that exists in the U.S.</p>

<p>In addition to these valuable technical tools, I urge you to take into consideration the "moral semantics" (motivational values and priorities) of users can be influenced by the Recovery.org platform.&nbsp; Of particular concern is the lack of public confidence in government.&nbsp; Recovery.org could be used as a platform for increasing public confidence, but only if it takes into account the existing motivations for distrusting the government and address them.</p>

<p>I agree that adding semantics is essential for making sense of the breadth and depth of data available, for discovering patterns of use and potentially abuse,&nbsp;and for supporting a variety of useful&nbsp;presentations based on citizen interests and areas of expertise.&nbsp; I also think that some&nbsp;novel approaches to navigation and visualization will complement the use of semantics to make the more widely accessible, and thus open the door for greater citizen understanding and participation.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>
				Simple Way To ReduceFraud -- Non-Obvious Relationship Awareness
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The Recovery Board should look to leverage cutting edge tools that provide "Non-Obvious Relationshiop" capabiltiies designed specifically for reducing fraud and waste -- These tools will help the Board identify "Who's Who, and Who Know's Who" with a high degree of precision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In many of the conversations that we at IBM are having across Federal Agencies and State &amp; Local government, leaders are telling us they are facing&nbsp;intensifying fraud challenges that are fast outstripping their capabilty to respond.</p>
<p>While the the types of fraud are wide and varied, two examples are -- 1) one individual of business entity submitting the same grant proposal multiple times, across multiple agencies, using he same or slightly different indentification attributes, and 2) The proposal "reviewer/approver" sharing the same address, phone number or other identifying information with the "proposer".</p>
<p>The good news is that the Recovery Board will be collecting an granular level of data&nbsp;on who is actually recieving Recovery Act investments, and how the dollars will be spent.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this level of data lies the opportunity&nbsp;for&nbsp;the board to&nbsp;develop a capability for &nbsp;"Non-Obvious Relationship Awareness" or NORA.&nbsp; This capability would provide the Identity &amp; Relationship resolution -- spotting common or similar addresses, phone numbers, etc, across multiple entities and identities -- thus allowing them to eliminate double dipping or conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<ul><li>Given the unprecedented level of investment the Recovery Act wiull bring to bear, it also presents the Board and the taxpayer with the potential for an unprecedented level of Fraud and Waste.&nbsp;&nbsp; If only 1% of the investment is lost to fraud -- a low number given historical averages for government programs -- <strong><em>the taxpayer will lose close to $8B to fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong></li><li>The capability for "Non Obvious Relationship Awareness" now exists, and is currently being used across the Federal Gov't in both social service and DHS/DOD agencies.</li><li>IBM provides these capabilities as a component of its "InfoSphere" suite, through its InfoSphere Entity Analytics&nbsp;Solutions (EAS)&nbsp; InfoSphere is an industry unique, unified platform for delivering trusted information.</li><li>IBM acquire NORA capability thrugh the acquisition of two small, best of breed SW companues. </li><li>As a part of this platform, Recovery.gov can leverage the same tools it would use for data quality, consistency and accuracy to reduce fraud.&nbsp; This extends the value proposition of any investment in these tools.</li><li>More information on InfoSphere and IBM Threat &amp; Fraud Intelligence can be found here:</li></ul>

<p>Before you look into tooling it is critical to understand the methodologies
rather than the tooling initially. you want to make sure you tooling

SMI-S, XAM, and Cloud Storage Standards.</p>
<p>As an example the Storage Management Initiative Specification (SMI-S) was
designed to collect, monitor and provision heterogeneous network environments
using standards. More importantly, this allows multi vendor support, a plug and
play methodology where interoperability is key to minimizing software
development and understanding you have vendor choice.</p>

<p>Standards are important, but the metadata tags needed to identify and discover information is absolutely critical before a common set of tool scan be implemented that will support the overarching goals of data transparency, disocery, etc. Even more important is having a well-defined policy for the government/public's objectives so that the appropriate metadata elements can be defined. Building or implementing tools prior to having these items defined will not enable the objectives to be met.</p>

<p>There are so many areas that the Recovery Act affects, it would be difficult to manage all that data on one site. I believe having the links that allow users to drill down to specific areas of interest is helpful. I will add that all of the Recovery sites should follow the same data formatting standards. For instance, if I am familiar with DOJ Recovery site, the DOT site shouldn't throw me for a loop. Those standards should apply to state and local Recovery sites as well.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				model local reporting process on online income tax sites
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>With April 15th still a recent memory, my suggestion is that the Recovery.gov reporting process mirror the process that on-line income tax reporting programs use (<a class="external-link" href="http://tinyurl.com/csvncr">Neal Hannon &amp; I explained this recently in a TechPresident op-ed</a>).</p>
<p>After all, many of those reporting on the expenditures will be small communities without a lot of staff ( even big communities may have lost a lot of their specialists who could do this function), Accordingly, the process must be designed so people with no special training or resources can still complete it quickly and accurately: that’s very similar to the challenge the online tax programs address.&nbsp; <br />Many of their features were designed to address parts of the tax filing process that directly parallel those facing reporting on stimulus spending:</p>
<ul><li>Don’t ask the recipients to make any calculations. Have the&nbsp; calculations run invisibly within the web site.</li><li>Instead, focus on designing a totally web –based process (so that you don’t have to worry about printed forms or government employees filling out traditional data files)</li><li>When you first log on to these tax sites, they ask you to provide some basic demographic information. That determines whether you fall into several classes where specific deductions might apply or additional information is needed. Since Recovery.gov must apply to every community from tiny ones to huge cities, it’s crucial to quickly assess&nbsp; what major categories a specific community may fall in (such as urban/rural, high unemployment/minorities/immigrants) so that the process can then automatically determine which categories are relevant and interactive processes to fill out each portion will be triggered.</li><li>Design the process so&nbsp; data entered locally is automatically&nbsp; augmented, or “tagged” with meta-data (“information about information’), using a structured data format such as <a class="external-link" href="http://www.xbrl.org/WhatIsXBRL/">XBRL, the eXtensible Business Reporting Language</a> . Once a specific piece of data has been entered into the reporting system and is tagged, it becomes what you might call a “data nugget,” with context and meaning garnered from the metadata. The data lives not as a form, but as information accessible by any computer program that can “call” or retrieve the data. On the Federal level, the FDIC already uses this approach to capture quarterly information from the nation’s more than 8,000 financial institutions.</li><li>Again, similar to the online tax programs, use the full range of Web 2.0 tools to guide those filling out the reports&nbsp; -- brief videos, reading the exact wording of the tax code, using&nbsp; wizard processes that guide you through the process, and (a recent addition) also let you pose a question to online users (via a wiki) who might be able to clarify the answer for you. The combination of all these tools acknowledges that we each have different learning styles and ways of processing information.</li><li>Finally, these programs run you through a final review and error catching process, based in part on whether your answers are exceptions to widespread norms (that doesn’t mean that the answers are necessarily wrong, just that they deserve more scrutiny on your part because IRS reviewers are also likely to scrutinize them more carefully). Why not a Recovery.gov variation on the theme?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>A lot of time and planning has gone into technology for the Recovery.gov website, where all of the reports on stimulus spending will be aggregated.</p>
<p>However, the biggest potential for errors is at the beginning of the process, when recipient communities have to report how they spent the money and the results. If those numbers are off, every succeeding step in the process will be skewed. Doing everything possible to reduce the chance of error is vital.</p>
<p>Online tax programs only ask for data, and automatically generate forms based on that data: the user doesn't have to make any calculations, reducing the risk of error. Likewise, an entity reporting stimulus spending in a rules-based format need not worry about anything but accurate data inputs. Reporting can be automated at the recovery.gov website.</p>
<p>A data-centric approach from start to finish in Recovery.gov is critically important. Collecting accurate data, as opposed to paper-based reports, provides increased accuracy and flexibility in both the collection of data and the reporting of the data. . If structured data is used, it could be accessed both instantly and simultaneously by a number of government agencies and externally by the public to assure accountability and transparency.</p>
<p>It could also be the model for a unified reporting process so that communities and states would be able to file a single data file, which, because it would consist of structured data, could be accessed simultaneously and instantly by every agency, both cutting reporting costs significantly and allowing simultaneous review by multiple agencies. Such a system,,<a class="external-link" href="http://tinyurl.com/cbmnj7"> the Dutch Taxonomy Project</a>, is already in place in the Netherlands.<br /><br />Online sites have radically streamlined the 1040 preparation process for many Americans. A parallel, cloud-based reporting system capitalizing on the many years of experience with the online tax preparation process could help Recovery.gov simplify the stimulus reporting process, capture structured data “nuggets” that could also be used in a variety of other reports, and significantly improve the accuracy of the stimulus reporting process.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Answering the first comment question about who the idea is directed, its both the Recovery.gov site and the recipients of the funds.&nbsp; Companies and government entities receiving funds could report on funds received and funds spent using the XML data format uniquely qualified to collect financial data, XBRL.&nbsp; The beauty of an XBRL based system is that if a closed-end, behind the user interface model is put in place, active business rules could help to ensure data integrity while collecting immediately reportable information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				Recover Act Project Information We Can Trust
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Mandate the use of a construction project management system by all recipients of Recovery Act infrastructure related funds. This ensures the information reported to Recovery.gov isn’t just project “information” but information we can all trust.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Construction project management systems are forward facing “systems of record” which provide the scope, schedule and budget details required to run a portfolio of infrastructure related projects.</p>
<p>The systems include standard, configurable reports providing transparency so all fund beneficiaries are known clearly, accurately and immediately upon contract award. They can track any goals or targets desired including jobs created per project and provide program and project status reports upon request or to public websites such as Recovery.gov.</p>
<p>Construction project management systems protect the validity of the information they manage through security and audible activity logs so every bit of information can be tracked and verified before it’s reported on. After all, most organizations managing large construction projects use these systems today for business critical decisions and compliance reporting. In fact, this is technology which the federal government already owns and just needs wider implementation.</p>
<p>There are many excellent ideas on this site which address the presentation and communication of information, but the most critical component to the Recovery Act program is transparency and accountability of our tax dollars being allocated, committed and spent and the associated results. Implementing a construction project management system enforces procedures and processes associated with contracting, change management, invoicing, competitive bids and field reporting so consumers of Recovery.gov information can trust the information on the site.</p>

<p>Thinking about the applicability of such systems to recovery act recipients, I beleive many project management systems include full modules for budget management and contract management.&nbsp; A project does not need to be exclusive to construction, but any project or program of collective work with a defined scope and timeline.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Establish&nbsp;the reporting standard, interval, specification (preferably XML) and provide Web Services façade that can be used by federal, state and local government entities to submit data. This must include regular (monthly/quarterly) data submission mandates.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The use of the XML-based report specification and Web Services will enable reporting entities to easily comply, automate and orchestrate their internal business process.

<p>One of the good examples to follow will be that of XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language). XBRL is a standards-based way to communicate business and financial information that supports information modeling and the expression of semantic meaning commonly required in business reporting.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">
<div>The goal of recovery.org is to create transparency around how stimulus dollars are being allocated and spent. The challenge to tracking, correlating, and analyzing relevant information is that this data is extremely heterogeneous. Some is captured in the spreadsheets that agencies post to recovery.gov. But, other important sources of data originate from many distinct agencies and cover a wide range of projects with differing metrics, definitions of terms, andcharacteristics. &nbsp;Data residing in a myriad of systems and formats make it hard for the average citizen to access it and interpret it. &nbsp;In short, complexity inhibits transparency.<br /><br />Recovery.gov should adopt semantic web technologies as key enablers for promoting an agile, transparent data ecosystem in which federal agencies and other recipients of stimulus monies can share spending and performance data in a way that is truly transparent, readily available, and useful to anyone who wants to view, consume, or analyze the information.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Semantic technologies were created to solve the problem of how to link and query heterogeneous data from files, databases, documents, and web pages. &nbsp;The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) publishes a set of open technology standards, known as Semantic Web technologies, for integrating disparate data in a way that is well-defined, traceable, easy to consume, and supported by a variety of tools.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Semantic Web technologies ease data collection by acting as a virtual integration layer. That is, agencies can and should continue to collect data in traditional databases, XML files, or Excel spreadsheets. Semantic Web technologies weave this information into a unified fabric so that it can be examined, analyzed, and understood by other citizens, legislators, oversight bodies, etc.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Application of semantic web technologies contributes to a “Web of Linked Data” that allows anyone with a Web browser to ‘surf’ a trail of data back to its source and better understand the information being published under ARRA's requirements.</div>
</span></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">
<div>ARRA requirements represent a fundamental step forward for transparency, openness, and accountability on the part of government agencies and those benefiting from stimulus funds. But, accessing spreadsheets that&nbsp;agencies use to&nbsp;summarize activity to recovery.gov is only part of the story. To detect waste, fraud, and abuse we need more encompassing data forensics. &nbsp;That is, information wants to be linked and correlated&nbsp;with heterogeneous information and data from many other sources. Making it easy to expose the semantics and structure of varied sources in a standard way is critical to investigative success.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the data is stored and presented in a way that is difficult to access or confusing, the interpretation will be that the government’s intention is to be something less than transparent. &nbsp;Making the data available in a way that is easy to consume and use will foster and image of true transparency on the part of the government.</div>

<p>I strongly believe this is the correct approach - and the literature backs up this claim. The Web has proven itself as a remarkable tool for sharing information, expressing data in the same manner is a natural development.</p>

<p>I fully agree with this concept. One of the goals of Recovery.gov is to make information about how stimulus money is spent availalbe to the average american. Assuming first that the average american even has access (some good comments already about virtualization and cloud computing to aid this), this kind of technology is necessary to present visual representations that will be easy to navigate. Some good examples already exist in news media we sites.</p>

<p>I also agree wholeheartedly with this idea.&nbsp; Semantics is needed to bridge the&nbsp;various organizations participating in the Recovery and their different uses of language and terminology, thereby increasing transparency.&nbsp; It is also essential to keeping the process more fluid, dynamic and responsive, since a semantic web can more&nbsp;readily evolve.</p>

<p>This is a win-win proposition. Most of all, by doing this the USA gov will catchup and possibly establish a leadership position on the use of technology that is essential for eGovernment / smart grids / virtual townhall meetings. Addtionally, it will introduce a strategic boost to semantic technology providers who are predominantly small businesses.</p>

<p>You know, using semantic technologies together with spreadsheet technology at the point of submission would be a really smart move. It would benefit the submitter two ways: first they would be able to report out (visualize) their data in a variety of ways easily using semantic lens technologies; second, they would be able to see (automatically, since the table structure for agency data submissions is the same) and analyze their data combined with that of other agencies. Just going this far is a benefit.</p>

<p>But, having data and table definitions in semantic form has other benefits. It makes it easier to combine recovery.gov data together with other information and data sources -- data, form, document, and web page. For example, to associate recovery.gov data with data.gov data and with open linked data from across the web. And much more. &nbsp;</p>

<p>First some negatives; I don't necessarily think the Gov. should be in the business of endorsing one particular service over the other.

Also, given that twitter is probably only known to 30% of the population (well 60% now that Oprah's on).</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Web-based Community, Resource, and Infrastructure Modeling/Accountancy
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Integrating, modeling, and visualizing all kinds of data-backed infrastructure and resource information on an open-standards, web-based platform provides the kind of ubiquitous transparency and accountability sought for Recovery spending.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a class="external-link" href="http://onuma.com/architecture/">Onuma Planning Systems</a> (OPS) is just such a system for hosting and integrating a large number of open standards software tools (including budgeting/costing) for modeling of community infrastructure, energy/natural resources, and buildings and has already been successfullly used by the Coast Guard, GSA, and other federal agencies for "low-carbon collaboration" on infrastructure planning, design, and project management.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Open-standards, web-based, low-carbon collaboration for Recovery spending is important because it provides the potentially transformative working model for project oversight and spending transparency and accountability sought in this initiative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
For years now, <a class="external-link" href="http://onuma.com/architecture/">Onuma Planning Systems (OPS)</a> has been at the forefront of the movement toward open-standards Building Information Modeling (BIM) championed by the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) and their <a class="external-link" href="http://www.buildingsmartalliance.org/">"buildingSMART alliance"</a>
<p> program. Further, open-standards BIM has been mandated for use on large projects of the GSA, ACE, VA, and other federal agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The special twist of OPS is that, at this time, it appears to be the only vendor-neutral, web-based system available to host and serve up models of buildings, other infrastructure components, and other diverse datasets in a Google Earth-based (Open Geospatial Consortium) environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more interesting is the fact that, due to its open-standards design, OPS is very extensible and can integrate and serve up virtually any kind of data and domain expertise in either visual models or structured data formats to diverse constituencies with role-based security permissions suited to their project involvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that vein, it would appear that OPS might also be useful, in some fashion, as a kind of neutral platform for modeling of the Smart Grid buildout and associated renewable energy project developmens for our New Clean Energy Economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In effect, OPS can integrate and host far more than just information and models of infratructure and buildings, and can likely further evolve as a kind of unified web platform for "open garden" modeling of most or all of the datasets pertinent to the sustainable change needed so that we can all see the change we want to become.&nbsp; Kind of like SimCity for the real world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
To see examples of OPS in action, check out their webpage on <a class="external-link" href="http://onuma.com/services/BimStorm.php">BIMstorms</a>
<p> - intensive online urban planning and design charrettes using OPS that have already been conducted in cities around the world.&nbsp; And tune in to the webinar training workshops and other matters pertaining to the upcoming BIMstorm San Diego on the weekend of June 12-14.</p>

<p>Transparency and accountability is sorely lacking in local and county governments. Current government websites do not address the impact of funding or numbers of people being served in the local community.&nbsp; Research shows that resource databases are lacking if they are from the State level down requiring hours of time to find resources and services.Databases that are online, HIPAA compliant and extremely secure are now available to be able to see if the services provided help a family to become self sufficient. 4People.org a Washington non-profit is a good model to make it easy for people to find the help they need, and a multi agency case management system to help inform communities of services that make a positive impact.</p>

<p>Creating sustainable cities requires expert knowledge from many different facets.

<p>This idea for a web based system to display existing and proposed public (and private) facilities using international building standards and systems has been a dream for over 30 years. If I understand this idea, a 3-d neighborhood and proposed changes can be seen by ALL stakeholders at the same time, and critical clashes between environmentalists, business interests, public policy interests, property owners, and others can "experiment" with changes in this digital model, see the impacts and cross impacts of those changes, and move toward design coherence and integrity and most important: realistic and verifiable&nbsp;Budget and Schedule data prior to construction. I have spent countless hours working on EIR and entitlement proposals from city staff presented in almost 19th century terms. I have seen millions wasted in time consuming conflicts over text, while a 3d picture would resolve conflicts. I have seen potential corruption and project failure because of silly review processes. GO BIM!!</p>

<h1>
				Using alerts and notifications to provide timely problem detection
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>One of the key benefits of data transparency is the ability to "crowdsource" the watchdog function - i.e., give millions of citizens the tools they need to mine information about stimulus spending (e.g., Recovery.gov), and they will raise an alarm if they see any potential mismanagement of taxpayers' dollars.<br /><br />However, even with unprecedented data transparency and sophisticated data analysis / visualization tools, there is still the possibility that instances of irregular spending will "fall through the cracks" given the sheer volume of data.&nbsp; And, as we all know, the longer a problem goes undetected, the harder it is to fix it when it is finally found out.<br /><br />A way to solve this problem is through implementation of a rules-based system of "alerts and notifications." This system would alert agency officials and any other interested party to any stimulus spending occurring outside the bounds of established parameters.&nbsp; The rules for generating an alert/notification would be tied to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) derived from accountability scorecards of the type described in my previous article located at http://www.thenationaldialogue.org/ideas/using-balanced-scorecards-for-performance-based-analytics . For example, an alert could be raised if a prime recipient reported excessive spending as compared to an associated KPI such as cost-per-job-created. <br /><br />Alerts and notifications can be provided to subscribers using various methods:&nbsp; RSS and Atom feeds, email notifications, automated telephony systems, and text messages, to name a few.&nbsp; A key benefit of having a system of alerts and notifications in place is more "proactive management of risk." In other words, oversight officials become aware of, and then can address,&nbsp; problem areas before they become front page news stories.<br /><br />There are numerous technologies, both commercial and open source, that can be used to implement the "alerts and notifications" features described in this article. For example, Unisys has developed a Recovery Act reporting solution that implements a system of alerts and notifications tied to its four different types of "accountability scorecards." The Unisys Recovery Act reporting solution was developed using various open source technologies, and is designed to integrate well with Government web hosting environments.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Federal Government Telecommuting Boondoggle
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>There exists in the federal government a program called telecommuting. Telecommuting is an agreement between federal unions and the federal government where the federal employee works at home from 1 day to 4 days a week. The problem with federal agency telecommuting is that there is no accountability for work done at home. Government management does not require a deliverable when a federal employee returns from working at home. Many perform there duties at work and claim that they accomplished a task at home when in reality they are having a 4 day weekend. How do they do this? Well they work 3 days a week for 10 hours a day. Then they claim to work 10 hours at home. So, the federal employee is at his or her duty station beginning on Tuesday and ending on Thursday. There are some cases where federal employees work 3 days at home and work 1 day a week at their duty station. One federal worker asked a guy who was telecommuting what he thought. The telecommuting federal employee stated, “it’s a boondoggle”. The taxpayer should not have to pay 40 hours a week for 30 hours of pay. This is a travesty. There must be accountability! If you work at home for 10 hours a day on taxpayer dollars then you must show a deliverable, work accomplished! How to enforce this is a matter of discussion, but make no mistake about it there needs to be a plan in place that corrects telecommuting boondoggles for the taxpayer is paying federal employees for an extended weekend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>It is a manner that answers the question? Is actual work being performed by federal employees at work while they telecommute. A deliverable is paramount for federal employees who work at home or for that manner any telecommuter. Accountability must be implemented otherwise telecommuting is denied.</p>

<p>What you describe is not an issue with telecommuting it is an issue with the management of staff.&nbsp; The responsibility of work productivity should fall on that person and be enforced by their manager.&nbsp; Telecommuting saves employees travel time and saves employers overhead costs.&nbsp; It is a non-monetary incentive that can be used effectively - and those are few and far between in these hard economic times.&nbsp; I think your rant is a bit ill concieved.</p>

<p>The discussion topics link box has potential, but in its current location, doesn't capture people's attention. It's also not organized in the most usable way. Arranging categories in the list either by "popularity" (not its rating, but the number of discussions - as currently illustrated by text size) or alphabetically might work better. And some kind of marker between categories would be good, too. As it stands, instead of scanning, you have to actually read to notice where the breaks are in: "data analysis and visualization data collection data warehousing." Also, with the sizes of the topics scattered, comparing one topic's popularity with another requires reading instead of scanning. Since the audience for the site is largely tech geeks, scanning is probably ingrained as the way to navigate a page.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Most people focus on getting the data <strong>into </strong>Washington,
which definitely is important. &nbsp;However, this proposal is focusing on
getting the data <strong>out </strong>of Washington, and into the hands of researchers,
not-for-profits, the media, colleges &amp; universities, individual citizens,
and anybody else who wants to review the data using their own research
methodologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, the Federal government collects literally
millions of data elements annually on a wide array of critical programs.&nbsp; Some of this information is shared in a
useful format so that those interested can gain access to the raw data and do
their own analysis.&nbsp; Unfortunately, by
and large, the vast majority of data collected by the Federal government is
either not made readily available to the general public, or is simply printed
in hard copy and very little is ever done with this data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that making this data easily accessible in
formats that facilitate data reporting has many benefits that go beyond just
government transparency. <br />
<br />
My team and I have designed a system architecture that enables each Federal
agency to make their data readily available to the public through various
modern means, from a single source, including Web Services, RSS Feeds, XML, and
other Web 2.0 technologies, as well as more traditional means such as FTP and
file extracts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

The key to this proposal is having each agency “plug
into” this system (we’ve code-named SEAT (System for Enabling Americans, and
for Transparency)), and make their data available.&nbsp; We have designed methods to enable the individual agencies to
make their data available to SEAT in many different formats as well.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This proposal allows interested parties to
access the vault of Federal data from one location in the format that is best
for them.&nbsp; Once able to access the data
and create their own meaningful reports and analysis, the general public will
be enabled to conduct their own analysis on the criteria they want.&nbsp; It will truly enable information sharing, and
thus, accountability and transparency.</p>

BHAI,

I'm not 100% sure if your question #1 is asking how the data is collected by the Federal government, or how is it collected by SEAT.&nbsp; I believe it's the latter, but if it's the former, the goal of this proposal is not to "dictate" to the Federal agencies how to collect the data, rather, to focus on what is done with it once it is collected.&nbsp; With that said, we do have some recommendations of how the agencies could best collect the data, which we can discuss offline.
<br />
<br />
As far as how does SEAT access the data, we felt that for many reasons it is important to have the data collected centrally by SEAT from the agencies.&nbsp; Some of the reasons are:
<br />
<br />
* Efficiency.&nbsp; We are literally dealing with billions of rows of data, and need to optimize hardware, throughput, etc.
<br />
<br />
* Transformations.&nbsp; In order to provide the variety of formats we offer, extensive and expensive transportations are needed that should only be done centrally
<br />
<br />
* Infrastructure.&nbsp; The concept of one location reliably grabbing data from dozens or more sources, in real time, would have a heavy load on the infrastructure for each of the data sources.
<br />
<br />
* Reliability.&nbsp; SEAT will maintain recently archived data.&nbsp; If one of the data sources is down and unable to provide its latest refresh (on some interval, say, weekly), SEAT will be able to provide the previous interval's data.
<br />
<br />
We have not found any exact prototypes of this model.&nbsp; However, there are many examples in State government agencies of data collection being done locally (for example, school districts) and rolled up to a State level for reporting purposes.&nbsp; We are just taking this approach to the next level of making this data more accessible via modern technologies.
<br />
<br />
I hope I have answered your question sufficiently.&nbsp; We are very eager to continue this discussion if you have more questions or want additional detail.

Crimedog,
<br />
<br />
Very good point about security.&nbsp; Thank you for bringing that up.
<br />
<br />
Of course security is paramount in any information system.&nbsp; It is the most important consideration in all aspects of system implementation, especially for SEAT.
<br />
<br />
There are really two aspects to your question that I'd like to answer separately.
<br />
<br />
Can the data be corrupted?&nbsp; We would implement all the industry standard security features such as HTTPS, TSL, SSL, etc.&nbsp; In addition, rigorous testing procedures ensure reliable quality.&nbsp; To implement a sensitive, large system like this, we would have a member on our team designated as our Information Security Officer.
<br />
<br />
Can "bad guys" get the data too?&nbsp; The Federal government obviously collects some sensitive data that should not be released to the public at large.&nbsp; Selecting what is appropriate as public information ought to be a decision made by each individual Federal agency, in conjunction with the National Chief Information Officer, and counsel.&nbsp; However, the benefit of SEAT is that there are already gigabytes of data that have already been deemed acceptable to release to the public, yet the public has no easy means to get to the data.
<br />
<br />
As far as cost, if requested, we could come up with a solid cost estimate, but it would take some investment of time on our part.&nbsp; I wouldn't want to just throw out numbers.&nbsp; If this proposal is being considered for the next level, we would be more than happy to provide that.

<h1>
				Map of Ongoing Recovery Projects
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Provide a simple, usable map using existing online mapping services that shows where Recovery money is being used, project-by-project, down to the local level. Although the money might be hard to track as it exchanges hands, in the end there's always a physical location where the actual work is being done. Show that location on the map and have the marker provide more information on who's involved with that project.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Citizens want to quickly see what is happening in THEIR state, THEIR county, THEIR city. Providing a mapping capability for all the work that is actually being generated by Recovery money is important for citizens to know where their tax dollars are being spent...or not.</p>

<p>It seems like this would be doable and extremely useful. People care about "what does this mean to me," and, often, that means geographically-based impact. This may require some estimation, especially in the early days of fund allocations, but combining "definitely local" data to the local area, with "estimated by locality" to funds that are still somewhat in-flight, would help people really understand <em>where</em> (in a literal sense) the dollars are going.</p>

<p>@jwarren: I think another comment mentioned the solution below yours. Really, there's a number of things Google Maps, MSN Virtual Earth, ESRI, etc. But the visualation will only be as good as the original data. If there's no standards for how the data is entered, not necessarily what is required to be entered but HOW it's actually entered, then it could be a nightmare to pull all that together.</p>

<p>Government integrity is not the problem; it's the people approving the contracts.&nbsp; In reference to Big $$ like the stimulus package, history should be our guide.&nbsp;We know there will&nbsp;always be&nbsp;attempts to undermine the Government from internal and external forces.&nbsp; These forces take on all shapes and sizes. However, since we cannot eliminate these negative forces, we have to control them or force them to comply. The way to do this is to have controls in place.&nbsp; 1. Establish an oversight committee responsible for reviewing and approving all stimulus contracts. 2. Every contract should clearly focus on job creation with evidence to prove this fact.&nbsp; 3. Reporting expenditures and every dollar spent on recovery should be clearly itemized.&nbsp; 4. Agencies should allocate stimulus funds only for economic development initiatives, not nice-to-have types of projects. 5. The responsible party that the stimulus monies will be allocated for&nbsp;or benefitted should report back to the federal government along with the contractor's who received the award. The paperwork must match. 6.&nbsp; Establish consistent reporting from all agencies receiving the dollars. 7.&nbsp; Assign&nbsp;several responsible persons to act as contract liaison&nbsp;with Government agency and funding recipient. 8. Institute a consumer response special taskforce to investigate&nbsp;every complaint about mismanagement, contract disputes, fraud, bundling, favoritism, discrimination, and any other complaint that surface. 9. Connect all agencies via a collaborative portal&nbsp;opened to the public and all parties involved with spending stimulus dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				The Simple Language Discussion
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I work in a narrower field; my job is mostly finding, analyzing, and communicating aggregate health care performance data. I have been working in public transparency of this data for eight years or so, and in that time I have learned this: if you make it too simple you will lose credibility. Therefore, I would suggest that a tiered communication method be used, wherein at first pass the information is simple and layman-friendly. However, options to surface or display8 additional data or deeper, "harder to understand data" should remain.</p>
<p>I would also counsel the group that it is very easy to dumb down data, it is a lot harder to convince your primary stakeholders, those being reported on, that the dumbed-down data is an accurate reflection on them.</p>
<p>I am not a graphic designer, my strength is in the data, but I have an <a class="external-link" href="http://hcrc2.abouthealthquality.org/show_group_compare.php?entity_type=hmo&amp;searchby=county&amp;searchcrit_county_county_id=31&amp;measure_group=10">example</a> of what I'm talking about at <a class="external-link" href="http://hcrc2.abouthealthquality.org/show_group_compare.php?entity_type=hmo&amp;searchby=county&amp;searchcrit_county_county_id=31&amp;measure_group=10">AboutHealthQuality.org</a> - if you click that link, below any data table is an option to display more detail. This was added after years of feedback from hospital and HMO staff who wanted more of the underlying data, or simply more detail.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Because making it simple is not so simple. The first and most vocal users are those being transparentized. Serve them too; with their buy in the product becomes much more valuable and friendly to work with.</p>

<p>Jeff: good idea, I can't edit the above post as far as I can tell, but I'll review as many as I can to see if more should be linked as well, although in response to that particular idea, I would advocate for publishing first, simplifying second. Simplifying can be a nightmare, and everyone and their brother thinks they know what the user will or won't understand. If you publish the data first, the Internet community can run with it and start posting it in numerous ways. For example, look at what these guys did with some hard-to-grip data: <a class="external-link" href="http://recoveryact.juiceanalytics.com/treemap/">http://recoveryact.juiceanalytics.com/treemap/</a> - I can't count the number of times I've had good data in my hands and seen it perish before publication because the committee in charge of making it meaningful couldn't agree or find consensus.</p>

<p>Simplifying, when approached properly, is not "dumbing down" information. It is making the information suitable for its intended audience. When there are mutliple audiences with varying levels of expertise, it is very appropriate&nbsp;to&nbsp;make layers of increasing detail available.&nbsp;A "summary to detail" approach is a logical one for the volumes of data available about the recovery program.</p>

				Enforce Americans With Disabilities Act
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Eliminate each and every concern that a disabled person fears in losing benefits, when attempting to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using and Internet Connection virtually anyone can contribute to the economy, Technology is already available that could make it possible for disabled persons to work from the homes. The Americans with Disabilities Act can be enforced if the burden of accommodating the special needs of a disabled person in the normal office environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost of transporting the disabled person from home to work is the second costly deterrent making it nearly impossible for a handicapped person to a place of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most Americans with disabilities could do some work but cannot control when and how much they can contribute due to the many health related factors that prevent them from pursuing gainful employment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only realistic solution is to identify jobs within the national economy that would be done on a flex-time schedule, from home, via a network and PC. Some of the jobs include: Call Center Agents, Data Processing, Medical Transcription, Teaching and Consulting in areas the disabled person might be knowledgeable in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tax breaks already exist for employers who wish to employ the disabled. However, the vast majority of employers can not create a workspace to accommodate, and have little or no education about their rights and responsibilities of employing the disabled. It is easier to just not get involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simple Solutions-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educate employers about their responsibilities and options under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensure that no disabled person will face losing benefits for making an attempt to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Offer genuine opportunities through an online job bank listing openings of flex time, tele-commuting employment.
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restore the self-esteem of the disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep it simple and keep it away from the states. Federal Programs work, State Programs have not.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>According the the Social Security Administration 3 out of every 10 gainfully employed persons working today, will become disabled before reaching the age of 55.</p>
<p>This resprsent millions of valuable human resources, and billions of dollars of money being directed into many different programs that only reach a token fraction of the disabled community. Aside from direct benefits, most of this money is being spent on social workers and other beaucrats who contribute little or nothing to actually effecting the lives of the dibbled and their families.</p>

pursue an higher education and contribute to our nations. People like

<p>Yes, employers discrimate against ageism, obesity, and individuals that are handicapped.&nbsp; I would rather work where there are regualar people and not all disabled, old or obese.&nbsp; That is clumping a group of people into one bracket the people that are tabo from society.</p>

				Standard Business Glossary
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>This is related to my earlier post regarding establishing "Trusted Information" as an objective of the Recovery Act eco-system.&nbsp; In "Trusted Information" the goals are strategy, governance, roadmaps and infrastructure.&nbsp; One excellent comment focused on "meaning" and I have to say I agree 100% that the development of a data model or schema in support of the ARRA requirements needs to have the proper context and meaning for the data elements.&nbsp; One approach for addressing the need for appropriate meaning within any eco-system is to have a consistent and well defined business glossary.&nbsp; A business glossary provides definitions and context for any data element within a schema.&nbsp; So in the scenario we are discussing in this exchange a core set of essential data elements needs delineation for the semantic usage and meaning which then permits the actual definition to be established.&nbsp; The foundation for this level of accuracy in building a data model is called <a class="external-link" href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/ips/products/masterdata/">Master Data Management</a> and with the proper implementation of a solution that defines the core of MDM it is a natural process to implement a <a class="external-link" href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/business-glossary/">business glossary</a>.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>It is critical that a solution dealing with data on the scale required for supporting ARRA should have all the proper underlying technology to ensure that the meaning of the data can be recognized and properly utilized.&nbsp; This brings context to the analytics and real value to the metrics that have been collected.</p>

<p>Not sure exactly what this is supposed to be but generally, it seems to make sense. However, my guess is that it would take tool long to implement, given the ARRA timeframes (stimulus, remember!!) and probably needs to be considered as a longer term project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like the whole concept of "master data management".&nbsp; It appears that the data could be standardized and have business rules applied with regard to the format and quality of the information.&nbsp; It's one thing to capture all the data that will be flowing between the Feds, states and local governments.&nbsp; It is quite another to ensure that the data is in a format that one can be sure will support the analytics required for such a large scale business intelligence application.&nbsp; Each organization needs to ensure that the data it is sending is clean and consistent.&nbsp; These tools sound like they might be able to make that a reality.</p>

<h1>
				Use managed spreadsheets for local agency reporting
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Allow agencies to report information in the data environment they know best (ie. Excel spreadsheets). When they are received at Recovery.gov they&nbsp;will be&nbsp;processed through a spreadsheet management system. This is a standard off-the-shelf software product, with proven scalability across large complex organisations and easily capable of handling millions of spreadsheets.</p>
<p>The processing of the spreadsheet information&nbsp;into a data warehouse provides many benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Complete data transparency</strong>, visibility and analysis right down to a cell level - across&nbsp;successive spreadsheet versions and between the submissions of different agencies.</p>
<p>Fraud and error detection - robust central monitoring ensures that anomalies and improper behaviour can be rapidly highlighted without significant manual effort.</p>
<p>High reporting flexibility to address the wide variety of requirements that will exist on day 1 but can adapt as new needs develop. This applies to both reporting into Recovery.gov and reporting from Recovery.gov to its stakeholders</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>All new data collection processes start with spreadsheets because they are low cost, familiar, flexible and fast. Migration to more formal applications requires time, for design, specification, build, rollout and user training.&nbsp;Recovery&nbsp;is too urgent to go through such normal IT cycles.</p>
<p>Using spreadsheet management as a data collection and warehousing prcess&nbsp;enjoys the advantage that all the required user knowledge already exists in the wide population and no new technology needs to be externally deployed.</p>
<p>The technology for data extraction, validation, warehousing and reporting on 'who, what, why and&nbsp;where' only needs to be present in the central locations ensuring a rapid, easy deployment. Dashboard information of all critical information and performane&nbsp;measures&nbsp;can be broadcast through many existing technologies including web pages. Agencies can get on with the business of leading recovery, not stuck in IT projects.</p>

<p>Although the concept of using Excel to track and report for the local agencies is a viable one, the simplistic nature of the solution sets conditions for failure.&nbsp; By using Excel to manage the distribution and use of funds you increase the risk of an error in data entry leading to inaccurate data and false reports.&nbsp; This doesn’t include the risks associated with a lack of discipline some users experience by deleting files accidentally, closing files without saving, etc. &nbsp;The concern isn’t with the simple, transparent approach, I fully agree with this methodology, but one should consider the use of additional business rules and restrictions to manage the data.</p>

<p>Keeping your idea and expanding on it, the local agency reporting should evaluate the use of an easy to use web based Software as a Service solution or a COTS Grant Management Solution (www.agatesoftware.com) with the defined data fields required for reporting presented in a clean and simple form.&nbsp; By now most people comfortable with Excel are comfortable with simple data entry in a web template.&nbsp; The data could be checked for errors on submittal and recorded in a database and duplicated for back-up purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of each time period, predefined or ad-hoc reports could be available to the general public down to the granular level.</p>

<p>Currently, the media are largely focused on fraud in their media outlets and create a false sense that banks are helpless to avoid it. The media portrays many banks as using manual auditing procedures that often fail to make the grade. By the end of 2009, we expect qualified trade media to become better educated about the ways automated spreadsheet management tools, such as those offered by ClusterSeven, can fight fraud and begin to shift their coverage from mere examples of fraud to the way these systems protect banks against it.</p>

				Normalize First, Collect Second, Analyze Last
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Placing all the emphasis on the final results or analysis puts the cart before the horse. It is important, yes. However, the KISS principle says first create a normalized set of data collection schema. This task is not a simple one, but it is doable. Once all the possible raw data forms are known, then and only then can the next task of analyzing the data begin.</p>
<p>First, normalize the outputs required to insure that one can verify the requisite data is being collected. This is where analysis comes in, it does define required data elements. Just don't get carried away by this part, focus on the data to support reasonable analysis, not far end results like images, charts, etc., etc..Next, create the supporting inbound data form(s), schema(s) and organization(s from available data as well as "new" needed data..</p>
<p>Then, and only then, can standardization of data per entity, program or project, be mandated. Care should be taken to insure onerous system re-writes are not imposed upon any public or private entity. In other words, find out what data they have available and make rational decisions when adding new data requirements.</p>
<p>Once that is done, data can be collected. Once the data is collected, the "what, when, why and how" the collected data is analyzed will be addressed by public and private entities around the world, albeit some correctly and some not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>To build any structure requires a solid foundation. For the "transparency and accountability" structure the foundation is data. If the data is not solid, any insuing output will adhere to the well known Garbage In, Garbage Out data syndrome. The data must be normalized to a concrete core, not a flimsy set of hundreds or thousands of bamboozling data sticks.</p>

<h1>
				Scorecards to Offer Insight into Current Performance on Stimulus Portfolio
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>ActiveStrategy StimulusScorecard - already on the GSA schedule for the federal government - is a low-cost, web-based performance management system designed to allow ARRA recipients to effectively and proactively monitor and manage their projects and programs. It gives officials one centralized view of the performance of stimulus-funded projects. The system makes real-time data available so governments can identify the preemptive action needed to prevent delays, waste, fraud, and abuse that could undermine program performance and public confidence.</p>
<p><a class="external-link" href="http://forms.activestrategy.com/go/activestrategy/nationaldialogue_stimulus_webinar">View a demo of the system during the second half of this recording.</a></p>
<p>The system requires virtually no IT support and can be online and ready to go in days. There is no software to buy or install - governments and agencies pay for the system only for as long as it is needed as part of the management and administrative costs of their stimulus projects.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>ActiveStrategy StimulusScorecard is important because it allows federal agency, state, city, and local officials to&nbsp; monitor and manage:</p>
<ul><li>How efficiently and effectively the dollars are being spent in real time (i.e. are the programs on-time, on-budget, and on-quality from their original plan)</li><li>How much impact there is on economic recovery (i.e. what long-term benefits are being realized in job creation, productivity, energy efficiency, etc)</li><li>Who is responsible for projects and what updates are they providing on performance</li><li>How many projects and how many dollars have been awarded, spent, obligated, or are pending<br /></li></ul>

<p>The problem is a standard scorecard is not enough.&nbsp; It does not go into the detail of the outcome.&nbsp; As a project manager, if I add 30% over what my real anticipated budget is, do I succeed when I come in 25% under that target?&nbsp; Or do I really fail because I really was 5% over?&nbsp; We need to get away from this on-time, on-budget because it is a HUGE fallacy to measure to.&nbsp; The ActiveStrategy scorecard is a rudimentary form of what is needed to truly track the ARRA funds.</p>

<h1>
				Don't buy more solutions...use what you already own!
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Instead of going out and spending more money on a solution or capability, the government should look at what it has already invested in and use it to do collection of&nbsp;data, storage, deliver analytics with a geospatial component (so people can search from a map of their area) and communicate it out to the public.</p>
<p>To give you an example, 90% of the US Federal government already own some super powerful technologies from Microsoft (including SharePoint and PerformancePoint and SQL) that are built with connectors specifically designed to connect too and draw data from almost any systems (Microsoft and non), provide tha ability to aggregate the data, display it on a map and filter that view,&nbsp;analyze the information by simple tables or full blown OLAP cubing, make it searchable and give users the ability to do further self-driven analysis using tools they all already know how to use, namely Excel with charts and tables! Even better this is all delivered through just a browser...so no version challenges or even the need for Excel on the local machine.</p>
<p>In addition it is already built with an inherent&nbsp;security model that provides the collection and dissemination of the data without exposing the underlying financial systems and doesn't necessarily need a data staging area (but can accommodate one if necessary).</p>
<p>I just want the government to examine the really powerful capabilities they all already have, and give the data to us Citizens in a format we are used to working with, and is secure!</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>It is already part of the government technology portfolio so it won't cost more money, and everyone knows how to use a web-browser and look at Excel charts! It is easy.</p>

<h1>
				Contractor Tracking and Oversight
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Implementing a universal system to track all federal employees (civil servants and contractors) for time and activity planning and tracking. The system already exists! By simply requiring contractor employees to utilize the&nbsp;time and attendance software already in place, the government&nbsp;would be able to&nbsp;count, account for, and tie to budget their contractor community&nbsp;as they currently do for their civil servants.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The government currently has no way to accurately quantify how many contractors are employed, what programs, projects, and activities they are working on, and to tie them to their budgets. Instead of establishing separate data collection, analysis,and reporting solutions, extending the use of software already implemented ensures success in addressing the contractor oversight issue. The added benefit is timely and accurate actual, certified, validated data instead of estimated, calculated, or survey-generated information. Since this data would be updated at least every federal pay period, it would be available real time, unlike contractor invoice timeframes requiring reconciliation or solving disputes.</p>

<p>This is an idea whose time has come... a long time ago.&nbsp; It's hard to believe that this is not happening already.&nbsp;&nbsp;The data collection systems are already in place so why not leverage them to greater efficiency by collecting data about contractor time.&nbsp; Once this information is readily available to government agencies, reports can be generated showing what projects are costing and how contractor time is being used.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s the kind of transparency that Americans are looking for – real data that demonstrates effective government spending or data that illustrates areas in need of improvement.</p>

				Successful Stimulus Oversight Using Project Portfolio Management Software
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>			
			Use web-based, automated project portfolio management (PPM) tools to accurately track the status of stimulus projects, the funds expended, the jobs created, and progress against any other relevant performance metrics.
			
			
			<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>PPM tools ensure maximum transparency and accountability as well as data accuracy and consistency by federating data collection and automating data validation as part of the overall management process.</p>
<p>PPM tools have a proven track record and can successfully:&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Provide for central collection of all data elements required by the Recovery Act;</li><li>Provide an easy way to collect the required information directly from the recipients of the stimulus funds, and integrate data reporting into the day-to-day activities of the stimulus projects.</li><li>Provide for accurate data visualization of national, state, regional, and local stimulus-related information through the effective use of graphs, charts, and tables; and</li><li>Provide the ability to implement and integrate new data reporting requirements as needed.</li></ol>
<p>PPM tools will provide Recovery.gov with a "shovel-ready" solution to the enormous challenge of providing the public with accurate, consistent, and complete data related to the spending of stimulus funds.&nbsp; Additionally, these automated tools will ensure an unprecedented degree of accuracy and transparency, providing a model for the improvement of other government database systems.&nbsp;</p>

				Focus on Accessibility NOT Normalization
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Thousands of federal and state agencies will be responsible for dispersing funding and tracking progress. It is completely infeasible to have one party responsible for the aggregation and normalization of all the data. As <a class="external-link" href="open-data-will-enable-democratized-analysis-and-accountability">this idea on open data</a> so clearly articulates, the fastest and most effective way to achieve high quality analysis is to open the data. The combination and normalization of data from multiple sources will be a significant portion of the analysis - but that should be left to the public. As the author of the open data idea suggests, agencies should focus on simply exposing the data.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Standard development and data normalization take years. The technology for agency use should focus on creating availability through REST endpoints that can be quickly added to live systems. The federal government should catalogue all the available services, but avoid being distracted by any attempt to define a consolidated and complete datamodel for all the data. Rich internet applications and mashups will be the fastest and most effective means to explore, mine, and combine data from the multiple sources.</p>

<p>Why: With a metadata repository - the model is the application.&nbsp; The model is immediately usable as an application to collect, present, or process data.&nbsp; With a SQL DBMS, database, and application, the conceputal model, logical model, physical schema,&nbsp;database, and application code&nbsp;are separate from each other and much harder to change when needed.&nbsp; In a metadata repository, these things are all typically built in or fully interoperable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, SQL is good for closed-world views of unchanging things for limited numbers of viewpoints, while metadata repositories are good for open-world views of evolving, adaptive, continuously changing things for unlimited numbers of&nbsp;customized user viewpoints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Object Management Group's (OMG) Model-driven architecture (MDA) approach for building and managing architectures (i.e., ontologies, viewpoints, knowledge-bases) of any type, you apply a four-layer metamodeling structure, with M3 being the foundation and M0 being the top.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With an open (i.e.,&nbsp;non-proprietary) MDA Four Layer metamodeling approach, you can model anything and everything in the universe and beyond - any system not just software.&nbsp; For example, using such an open metadata repository, we could build&nbsp;a <em>National Terminology for ARRA, having a unifying Management Life Cycle process to which other processes and life cycles are mapped, with consistent sets of management controls throughout the unifying life cycle, to which other processes' and applications' management controls, such as performance metrics,&nbsp;are mapped</em>.</p>
<ul><li>M3 contains the object model (made available&nbsp;by the physical model/metadata repository software and hardware), where all modeled "things" are given their core inherited attributes and their core reusable "types" of relationships. </li><li>M2 contains the basic set of things, also called classes or types, that are named, related, and described&nbsp;in&nbsp;the domain being modeled.&nbsp; This is where you build all models (using the M3 object and relation types) and instances that are used as references (e.g, Dictionaries, Taxonomies such as the OMB Reference Models, Thesaurus, Lookup Tables, Master Data, Master Metadata)&nbsp;by all other models and instances.&nbsp; You also built your integrating models at this level, e.g., a model for integrating M1 layer database designs across various M1 application designs and process models.</li><li>M1 contains the diverse models of viewpoints in the community of users (i.e., concept maps, data models, process models, business rules, forms, reports, business and geographic visualizations, ontologies as knowledge models and architectures, axiologies as value-chain models as in&nbsp;value-added economic models, database structures, software applications,&nbsp;etc.), built by referring (e.g., via automated lookup) to the M2 references.</li><li>M0 contains the diverse data of the community of users, accessed for input, transformation,&nbsp;or output, through the viewpoint designs modeled at the M1 level, and populated where possible with M2 lookup values, e.g., the&nbsp;equipment data-values (selected from an M2 lookup)&nbsp;in the&nbsp;equipment form (M1).</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>An open metadata repository is a quantum leap forward in world modeling and data management over SQL.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Provide a Citizen-centric Collaborative Portal
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>To fulfill its transparency and accountability mission, Recovery.gov should be a collaborative Portal that gives citizens visibility to information on how their tax dollars are spent.&nbsp; Recovery.gov should provide citizens with tools for interacting with the Portal and for placing the available information in a meaningful context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Institute for Public Service Value has conducted research that identified the following critical success factors for Web-based transparency and accountability tools, each of which is relevant for Recovery.gov:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplement financial data with “public value” Return on Investment metrics--defined by citizen-centric <em>outcomes</em> and <em>outputs</em>—enabling all citizens to easily understand spending effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide an intuitive, customizable and user-friendly interface so citizens can easily access relevant data, including spending at the agency, department, and geography (zip code, neighborhoods) levels.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide real-time data and statistics that enable quick comparison of performance and spending over time.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generate annual reports on agency budget and financial performance with short- and long-term financial plans, financial audit and performance review results, and historical trend data.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhance the Portal with public education programs that arm citizens with a deeper understanding of government spending priorities, strategies and operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is important that Recovery.gov be more than a static website that just pushes information out from the Government. &nbsp;Support for stimulus program can be generated by building the options below into an interactive Portal:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offer citizens the standard option to view information anonymously</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offer citizens the option to log in to the Portal and customize it based on their interests</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offer content that complements stimulus funding data, such as:</p>
<p>§&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; News feeds</p>
<p>§&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Central Contractor Registration information about the vendors receiving stimulus funds</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offer alerts tied to stimulus funding updates, news or editorial content updates, or additions of discussion items</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offer chat/blog capability that enables citizens to interact with Government agencies</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offer agency- or program-specific Idea Forums (similar to the IT Solutions Recovery Dialogue)</p>
<p>Providing these features will give citizens a chance to feel involved in the Recovery process, and will increase public support for the overall stimulus program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public support for the stimulus program will be further enhanced if the ideas above are enabled quickly. &nbsp;Data collection for stimulus reporting can be accelerated by establishing a clearinghouse for information and creating a standardized data template across stakeholders. &nbsp;Recovery.gov Portal functionality can be ramped up in the shortest amount of time by modeling features provided in existing public sector Portals. &nbsp;Some notable examples are listed below:</p>
<p><em>New York City</em><em>: the “NYCStat Stimulus Tracker”</em> (<a title="http://www.nyc.gov/html/ops/nycstim/html/home/home.shtml
blocked::http://www.nyc.gov/html/ops/nycstim/html/home/home.shtml" href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/ops/nycstim/html/home/home.shtml"><u>http://www.nyc.gov/html/ops/nycstim/html/home/home.shtml</u></a>)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides up-to-date project-specific and neighborhood-specific stimulus spending information</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shows how stimulus funds are distributed to different projects</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provides an interactive map that visually compares spending and progress across neighborhoods</p>
<p><em>State of Maryland: “</em><em>Maryland</em><em> Funding Accountability”</em> (<a title="http://www.spending.dbm.maryland.gov/
blocked::http://www.spending.dbm.maryland.gov/" href="http://www.spending.dbm.maryland.gov/"><u>http://www.spending.dbm.maryland.gov/</u></a>)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows users to view information on vendor payments exceeding $25,000</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enables search by agency, vendor, or vendor zip code for vendors receiving payment</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Displays the dollar amount each individual vendor received in the last fiscal year in each zip code</p>
<p><em>State of Kentucky: “Kentucky's OpenDoor”</em> (<a title="http://opendoor.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx
blocked::http://opendoor.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx" href="http://opendoor.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx"><u>http://opendoor.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx</u></a>)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enables citizens to access detailed financial information and view it graphically</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Includes a fully interactive kids section with games and cartoons to provide training on government finance</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Includes a budget tutorial that allows the average citizen to learn about state expenditures, revenues and budget development</p>
<p><em>State of Texas</em><em>: “Open Book Texas”</em> (<a title="http://www.window.state.tx.us/openbook/" href="http://www.window.state.tx.us/openbook/"><u>http://www.window.state.tx.us/openbook/</u></a>)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shows how the government purchases goods and services in terms of leveraging buyer power</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows users to access transparency information for cities, counties, school districts, river authorities, and metropolitan transit authorities</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Displays what data agencies have made available online and what data they have not</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, it will be critically important for the Federal Government to work closely together with state and local governments in the areas of governance and program management.&nbsp; These efforts will help ensure data quality across federal agencies and state and local communities, and will help Recovery.gov present a “single version of the truth.”</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Building out Recovery.gov as a citizen-centric collaborative Portal will give Americans a chance to feel involved and engaged in the stimulus program.&nbsp; Providing contextual and outcome-based information will make the core stimulus financial data more meaningful for citizens. &nbsp;Making stimulus data and interactive Portal functionality available quickly will satisfy the demands of citizens to know how their tax dollars are being spent as soon as possible. &nbsp;All of these ideas are geared towards showing Americans that their Government is being responsive to the interest of its citizens, and are therefore crucial for garnering and sustaining public support of the stimulus program.</p>

<h1>
				U.S. Government can improve its portfolio management capabilities
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Between the Economic Stimulus funding, the shift in government priorities and increased transparency and management requirements, the agencies need an end to end solution to swiftly rearrange, optimize and manage their portfolio of programs to ensure that their spending is aligned to their strategic objectives.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The new administration has an increasing focus on improving how funds are spent and reported while saving money to the taxpayers. &nbsp;Millions of work hours are spent every year within the agencies to gather data and create static reports on the progress of programs. That gathering, analyzing and reporting of capital investment data can be a cumbersome and time-consuming process. This can prevent portfolio managers and program managers from spending time analyzing and managing their programs. While tools already exist to assist with portions of the Portfolio Management lifecycle, they usually are disconnected from each others. An &nbsp;adaptable end-to-end solution like our <a class="external-link" href="http://www.epmconnect.com/US/CPIC%20in%20Federal%20Government/Pages/Scenario.aspx"><u>CPIC</u></a> Solution enables today’s users within the Federal Government to select, control, evaluate, report and manage their investments (technically, taxpayers could have access to reports as well). Some of the benefits from such a solution, keeping in mind that the specifics metrics to be reported can be adjusted, are:</p>
<p>ü&nbsp; Provide for a complete &amp; accessible investment inventory.</p>
<p>ü&nbsp; Provide a single source of information to facilitate evaluating, priority and balance.</p>
<p>ü&nbsp; Greater Audit Ability as Documents are Created</p>
<p>ü&nbsp; Enable project reporting and ease of access.</p>
<p>ü&nbsp; Ability to Integrate with other LOB Applications</p>
<p>ü&nbsp; Reduced Training Time</p>
<p>ü&nbsp; Maximize the agencies’ investment in technology by providing a solution which uses existing investments</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that such a solution will enable the U.S. Government to be more agile and more efficient with our tax dollars. I am interested in your feedback</p>

<p>As a point of clarification, the above solution is composed of many products that the U.S. government already owns and can be used&nbsp; for different purposes. Depending on its configuration,&nbsp;It can help manage the "recovery.gov"&nbsp; project as well as managing, selecting and controlling the investments made as part of ARRA or&nbsp; any other programs. So it is not a new development effort and it does include visual indicators to enable easier decision making capabilities. I hope it clarifies a bit.</p>

<p>Fortunately I remember my commentor saying that denunciating this "discussion" initiative would be too early at this time. While typing I cannot see his/her response, so that's a fundamental flaw! Listen, I reviewed all "recommendations" and this in NOT what you want, I'm sure. But I'll keep my mouth shut, since this of coaurse is a National discussion and I am responding from The Netherlands. Shouldn't you have blocked that? Lots of success; I like the initiative but don't think it will be helpful at all.</p>

<p>Jaap, interesting idea.&nbsp; When propaganda machines are running smoothly, it's hard to break it. I watched the movie "Milk" the other day. I believe it's a good example how hard it is to make a difference.</p>

<p>So is it a waste of money? I'm not sure and here's why. Many people are so busy with every day life that all they want to do when they come home is watch some tv (and listen to the main steam media who run their own controlled agenda). In the weekend there's sports events, a movie theater and other "entertainment" to keep the population happy. Just like Julius Caesar used the Gladiator games to keep his people happy.</p>

				A centralized online procurement system for all gov business opportunities

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>There should be a online procurement system for all government business opportunities. Federal, State &amp; Local- grants, bids, RFPs and award data all tracked on a public procurement system. All agencies would be required to post their bids and RFPs in this system and the process could be tracked from grant to award.<br />All of these 80,000+ Federal, state and&nbsp; local agencies post this data in 80,000 different places. Their own websites, local business journals, newspapers, city council meeting notes etc... It's not centralized anywhere and therefore not transparent, but also limits competition in some cases to only those people/companies that can dig through all that data and identify these opportunities.</p>

<p>Consolidation is very important - it would promote efficiencies in systems and processes.&nbsp; It would also promote transparency - finding information on ALL procurements today is very difficult, even for a single agency.&nbsp; It should also reduce costs by providing a single environment to all agencies.</p>

<p>Great idea. However one online procurement system is, as suggested by first comment, too ambitious. The Feds of course have been working on this for years with the Integrated Acquisition Environment, making much progress with FedBizOpps and the FPDS. A lot needs to be done were the State &amp; Local world to be included. Perhaps, as with other large/distributed data consolidation/sharing efforts the key is to establish standard data format so the environment can evolve in a distributed manner. Promote conistent data&nbsp;and aggregation will in effect consolidate more effeciently.</p>

				Technological Neutrality
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Any technology chosen by the Administration to help Recovery.gov should be accomplished in a technologically neutral way - that is, no one type of IT business model / development model should be chosen by virtue of the model alone.&nbsp; It guarantees little.&nbsp; Keeping choice based on the merits / goal of effectively communicating Recovery opportunities must remain paramount.&nbsp; Technology on its own is only a means of getting there.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>When you make a choice for only one type of model - let's say, open source - you are necessarily cutting out other options which may do the job as well or better.&nbsp; Looking at the goal - not the "rocket ship" to get you there - will enable the widest possible choice, and the best bang-for-buck for administrators and constituents.</p>

<p>The audit trail needs to be part of tracking all actions in all activities by all ARRA participants, much as Sarbannes-Oxley requires of corporate finance.&nbsp; The audit trail must also be able to go to a management repository that is consistently applied by all participants, otherwise, the audit trail will be blocked, grow cold, or be misdirected, all leading to the potential for mismanagement, waste, abuse, and fraud.</p>

<p>While I agree that an audit trail is critical, these steps are already in place.&nbsp; Additionally a key part of the ARRA is that every Federal Department or Agency that recieved funding to oversee and implement the distribution of stimulus funds&nbsp;also had monies allocated to their Office of Inspector General&nbsp;to make sure that&nbsp;there was clear accounting and audit trails&nbsp;for all of the stimulus funds.</p>

<p>The bigger issue behind having an audit trail is that there needs to be a way for the public to be assured that the money that has been distributed as part of ARRA is tied to results and that is why every Federal department or agency that is part of ARRA are required weekly to post their progress to <a href="http://www.recovery.gov">http://www.recovery.gov</a>.&nbsp; It is just as important to see how the money was spent and how that contributes to the financial recovery as it does how much was spent.</p>

<p>Hey, this is a great idea. This would allow the dialogue that recovery.gov is trying to faciliate to be much more broad based. There are literally millions of blogs, most of which are specialized. Spreading widgets to these blogs brings the information collection closer to those who are most involved rather than expect everyone to navigate to a small number of specialized sites that already seem overloaded. Yahoo has some great widget technology (formerly Konfabulator) that works with both Mac and PC so no one needs to reinvent anything. Just deploy with recovery.org architecture, branding and information pass back. I say YES!!!!

<p>These widgets would point at the recovery.gov website and allow end-users to customize their look for integration into their own blog. Outside of producing something that "looks" like the widget with falsified data, there would be no falsifying of the information. That is to say, sure, it is possible to reproduce the way a widget works and throw in bogus data, but that would be about as impactful as someone who registers something like recovery-now.net or something and reproduces the look and feel of recovery.gov, but with bogus data. The end result? Who cares! Widgets would really allow bloggers and others to own this movement.</p>

<h1>
				Individualized Reporting and Tailored Interface
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Migrate recovery.gov into a true portal structure, with information resources identified as such, and allow users to create their own interface to these resources, available either via the web or handheld device. Users should be able to create profiles containing which information resources they wish to see, and manipulate those profiles to show those resources in the manner best suited to each user.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>As information produced by agencies, states OMB, and fund recipients continues to grow, centrally organizing, managing and presenting that information to a disparate user base will become more and more challenging and time consuming. Developing and implementing standards such as XML for some of the data to be collated helps, but when there exists so much data in other formats from other sources (RSS feeds, excel reporting sheets, structured databases, web page updates, etc.), consumers of that data are faced with a nightmare of finding, and then staying abreast of changes to particular information that interests them.</p>
<p>Treating each area of information as a source of data, and then allowing users to be able to select which sources they wish to see, and the manner in which they see them, will engage more users and offer them more meaningful use of the data that interests them.</p>

<h1>
				Use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Use of GIS to track where recovery&nbsp;funds are being spent, and analize where the funding is truly needed.&nbsp; At its core, GIS&nbsp;is inherently used to make decisions in regards to Geography and the information behind those locations.</p>
<p>Governments of all sizes (City, County, State, and Federal) currently use GIS for many of their daily operations.&nbsp; This infomration needs to be captured at the local level, and moved "upstream" to County levels, and then State, then Federal, to have the most current, accurate information to be used for the analysis behind where the funds need to be spent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Maps, and mapping systems are well known interfaces to the public.&nbsp; Google Earth, Google Maps, Microsoft Virtual Earth, Mapquest, etc...&nbsp; are all applications that the public has become accustomed to using.&nbsp; By using a true Geographic Information System with appropriate analysis capabilities, and feeding this information into such vehicles for public consumption would be a win-win.</p>
<p>While I'm not a software vendor, just a local government GIS guy, I see that the ESRI products handle the "heavy GIS analysis" side of the puzzle, and can interact seamlessly with those tools the public is currently taking advantage of - such as Google Earth, Google Maps, etc...</p>
<p>Analysis is the key, and having current information from the local levels fed up through the system to be used for this is imperative.</p>

<p>I definitely agree that "geospatial" should be a required component of any of the data provided by the Recovery.gov site. In addition, geospatial visualization and light-weight analysis can be provided by the site and tools. In this way, then yes, Recovery.gov will in fact utilize GIS.</p>

<p>However, it would probably not be useful to attempt to build in complex analysis. The site should focus on transparency, shareable data (including geography), and simple tools.

<p>I strongly agree with this recommendation.&nbsp; An integrated and layered approach would indeed support better analysis but just as importantly it would serve to greatly improve broader public understanding of the issues being addressed. It also can be used to improve understanding the inter-connectedness of many of the issues.&nbsp; This should leave to more effective cross issue policies and interventions.</p>

				Interesting Cloud Approach to Track Stimulus Funds FAST
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Saw this post yesterday about a solution that helps agencies track, manage and oversee stimulus&nbsp;funds and can launch in 30 days because it is based upon Salesforce.com cloud computing solution. Gives Program Managers and Inspector Generals all they need to manage and monitor programs both at top level and down to the detail.&nbsp; Perhaps&nbsp;the government should explore&nbsp;flexible IT for mission critical programs that need to launch fast.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://gcn.com/articles/2009/04/29/acumen-offers-stimulus-tracker.aspx">http://gcn.com/articles/2009/04/29/acumen-offers-stimulus-tracker.aspx</a></p>
<p>Link to video demo of product here...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.acumensolutions.com/START.asp">http://www.acumensolutions.com/START.asp</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Solves the issue of how an Agency can spend fast on shovel ready projects yet not lose the ability to track manage and oversee where the funds go.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems compliant with all the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and OMB mandates. Having been built on a flexible platform enables easy&nbsp;updates should the regs change in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds interesting.</p>
<p>In terms of security risk, it is mostly public information anyway (funding allocations) and the risks&nbsp;of losing track of the money seem higher than the risk of data in the cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thoughts?&nbsp;</p>

				CLOUD COMPUTING - using a pool of dedicated resources
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Cloud computing is cheaper than the legacy model of IT without reducing or impacting uptime, and provides a more efficient computing platform on a watt for computing capacity basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery.gov should be a poster child of the modern IT solution.&nbsp; This would include 100% virtualized computing resources that are out sourced to an industry leader in providing commercial companies “cloud” services.&nbsp; This will allow a cost competitive solution based solely on the solution and not on the acquisition, initial, support, and other elements inherent in a asset ownership model – this amounts to up to a 50% reduction in operating costs including the initial startup.&nbsp; The cloud has the added benefit in increasing the platform availability, and allow flexible and right sizing of the solution without buying or decommission hardware assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Cloud solution has the added benefit in being GREEN – as there is an estimated 60% reduction in hardware costs and power usage.&nbsp; The net effect of this is a reduction in the carbon footprint and power consumed in a datacenter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, I agree tracking expenditures is important.&nbsp; We need to also track actual expenditures against estimated costs in the proposal and % complete of the project to determine if&nbsp;the project is on&nbsp;track (monthly or quarterly or whatever).&nbsp; In addition, we need to measure outcomes like Jobs created,&nbsp;commute time or gas consumption reduced with a new road,&nbsp;or whatever the project identified as a benefit or&nbsp;outcome, not just that the money&nbsp;was spent but that they completed it on time, within budget and all goals were met.&nbsp; Finally, company award is important as the idea states.&nbsp;In addition,&nbsp;a link to the hiring entity and open positions might help prospective job seekers learn about the project and possible employment opportunities in the projects' geographic area.</p>

<p><strong>introduce a 3D user interface into recovery.gov for rapidly navigating data about recovery projects and enhancing their transparency.&nbsp; The proposed visualization technique draws upon two patterns common to both large-scale initiatives and smaller-scale projects, regardless of focus:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>&nbsp;All projects reflect by nature a decision to initiate a set of actions based on an observation of need.&nbsp; Consequently, projects cycle through four simple phases from observation through implementation, and this simple cycle can be used to both visually organize and rapidly navigate through multiple projects, and access related information. </strong></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Projects are both hierarchical and relational by nature.&nbsp; This enables an intuitive approach to 3D object-within- and object-to- object navigation without requiring the use of a geospatial context like that used in Google Earth. </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The proposed 3D navigation interface will be made available as a web service so it can be readily combined or mashed-up with rich information discovery and filtering techniques such as semantic lenses to enable intuitive 3D navigation of recovery information that is specifically relevant to citizen interests and abilities.&nbsp; Users will have the ability to select multiple filtering attributes through a series of dropdowns and sliders, and transparent visual layers will enable rapid, “fly-through” navigation to specific areas of interest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>This approach could readily make use of the current data being reported via the AARP TAFS detailed spreadsheets, as well as integrating additional project-specific details that could be made available by recovery project sponsors and managers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our team has applied a similar approach to enhance community awareness, collaboration and participation in green technology innovation.&nbsp; We have recently proposed a richer 3D visualization interface to help the US Army Chief Information Officer enhance awareness, alignment and resource utilization across Army IT projects.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p><strong>Despite the laudable efforts to make spending transparent through recovery.gov, it is very difficult for citizens to&nbsp;readily navigate through the current set of online data, assess how their money is being spent, and, in particular, to judge the&nbsp;outcome or benefits being derived from those investments. This is largely because of the widely distributed, specialized and highly inter-related nature of the Government organizations and initiatives participating in the recovery.&nbsp; Consequently, President Obama is unable to maximally leverage the insight, skills and common sense participation of citizens to help ensure the best use of these recovery resources.&nbsp; The proposed 3D user interface will help enhance transparency for the recovery effort, but may prove even more beneficial with expanding citizen participation in the critical Government transformations yet to come, and with finding the resources necessary to make those happen.</strong></p>

<p>Having a meta level birds eye view of how all the projects relate so to make it much easier to see the status of a project and its steps in association to other projects might just require 3D and a semantic based system alright !!</p>

<p>I fully agree with this idea.&nbsp; It also emphasizes the need for a consistent terminology as the basis for the data to be visualized, and thus for the 3D (and multi-dimensional) visualization for those seeking, submitting, and connecting information.</p>

<p>For a terse explanation I think there's a really interesting thought here. People looking for jobs are told they're out there, but it seems like either there's a large disconnect or that the hiring companies are overwhelmed with applicants.</p>

<p>It's clearly dependent on time to shake things out and reduce the pool of applications but if some effort (like the twitter #rtjobs rally) could be made to make the searching / screening process more efficient then that would help immensely.</p>

			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I recommend a user-frienddly ARRA DSS (Decision Support System) for ARRA data and business analysis and data integrity. I have already built a "PROTOTYPE"&nbsp;&nbsp;system using data from <a href="http://www.recovery.gov">www.recovery.gov</a> and USAspending.gov. This is based on Vapsoft software which I designed. Very user-friendly and end-user computing tools. I would like to offer a demo to your team. My power-point-based material was submitted to Mr.&nbsp;Dan Germain, Project Diretor. Also some of output reports were published in my website: <a href="http://www.nonprofitsdata.com/1J_ARRA.htm">http://www.nonprofitsdata.com/1J_ARRA.htm</a>. Please review this site. &nbsp;These types of reports will be generated online by the ARRA end-users. I would like to present a demo via WexEx or remote access method. I would like to build a "PROTOTYPE" application free of charge if you provide Excel-based ARRA data.&nbsp; Vapsoft is my copyrighted software and very powerful end-user computing software tool. This software will be excellent solutions for ARRA decision support process. I will send&nbsp;my Powerpoint materials to you if I have your email addresses. I will present a demo to you any time when you are available. &nbsp;&nbsp;My contact info: David Yoo, Vapsoft &nbsp;<a href="mailto:dcyoo@msn.com">dcyoo@msn.com</a>&nbsp; 402-312-9740. I would like to hear from you. Thank you</p>

				Systems to gather data.
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>There are multiple systems currently in use that gather lots of data.&nbsp; Rather than creating new systems, lets improve the systems we have to ensure they are "user friendly", intuitive, have edit checks to minimize erroneous or conflicting data, ensure that mandatory fields are mandatory; minimize data collection that is not needed and provides clear instruction, on-line, to the user.&nbsp; Another system is not needed; better current systems are needed.&nbsp; When improving the current systems, the reporting and searching capability needs to be improved as well.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Existing systems capture significant amounts of data; however, they are not intuitive nor are they "user friendly".&nbsp; This applies to their search and reporting capability as well, which is of particular interest to the public.&nbsp; Before investing in new systems, determine if existing systems can be improved.&nbsp; If not, get rid of the existing system and substitute a new, intuitive, user friendly system.&nbsp;</p>

It seems the point made above on existing Federal, State and Local systems is one of the more important aspects to consider when designing a central system for collecting and reporting on payment and performance data - especially considering the data is coming from hundreds of unique sources, at all levels within the Recovery Act Fund disbursement/recipient chain.
<p dir="ltr">Agencies at all levels have invested significantly into their existing systems and processes. Many of which have voiced that they will be stretched significantly thin in terms of financial and human resources in order to execute against the new reporting and tracking requirements. Understanding that all agencies are working hard to implement infrastructure that will enable the tracking of funds-flow and usage (along with performance) down to the sub-recipient level, it would help greatly if these agencies did not have to make costly investments into their existing systems or processes to be both compliant and accurate with their ARRA reports.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The central system in discussion should have a robust capability to collect and digest data from the hundreds of disparate systems/sources that make up the appropriation flow - Federal Bureau &gt; Recipient &gt; Sub-Recipient.&nbsp; In other words, the system should map to existing systems and processes today and not require agencies to make big changes on their side.&nbsp; Additionally, the system&nbsp;should have the capability to than apply rules-based processing to ensure the data is both compliant and accurate based on both OMB ARRA requirements and individual agency financial management requirements , while facilitating exception management where discrepancies might occur. In this scenario, the system is driving collaborative, real-time reconciliation that is supported by a consistent environment for data collection, matching and reporting. This would ensure all data reported into the system is reliable. By setting up a collaborative structure like this, we would have a central system for both collecting and reporting more precise information on Recovery Act funds, but also a critical and central source for analyzing the audit trail at a very detailed level.</p>

<p>Any system implemented should have three "views" available, one which displays the data relevant to each category.&nbsp; As <a href="http://www.recovery.gov">www.recovery.gov</a> has been up and running for a while, it may be relevant to qualify the users as they enter that site as falling into one of those three categories, and track the usage of that site by category.</p>
<p>If you look at Facebook (which is the successful massively multiplayer web application of the moment), it does&nbsp;four things well.</p>
<p>1) Searching (keyword based auto complete based on user defined relevance, e.g. "friends" in Facebook)</p>
<p>2) Interactivity (ability for user to contribute to dialogue at anytime, and for dialogue to be seen for a while, it makes the user feel important, whether anyone actually reads the post or not)</p>
<p>3) Open Format (third party applications which allow the community itself to define what works and what does not, which raises replay value).</p>
<p>4) SIMPLICITY (the core application does not delve beyond the four or five basic things that it does well, and has enhanced the simplicity of those core functions over time).</p>
<p>This system should focus on core elements as well, if its intended audience is the American people.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>If we truly intend to service the American people with a solution, it should innovate what has become standard in web interfacing.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem oversimplified, as one user could occupy multiple roles.... I like the idea of simplicity for the citizens, especially if they are the target audience.... The application can be as complex and secure as it needs to be, but the presentation to the user&nbsp;should be simple and the design as simple as possible...</p>

<h1>
				Organize Participation Through Coalescent Bubbling
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>My approach is to divide the "transparency" issue into two parts. <br /></p>
<p>1) <strong>Sunlight</strong>. This involves a commitment to better enabling&nbsp; public <em>reading</em>
of existing data. There's recently been lots of progress and that front. It means making information available in multiple
forms... pre-refined visualizations, raw formats that others can mashup
and refine, or some kind of semi-raw,&nbsp; and a standardized XML-ish
format that's easier to rewrap.&nbsp; But it raises the problem of which
sets of data are the most reliable and useful, which "answer" is most actionable, and which publication standard should be formally selected.<br /></p>
<p>2)&nbsp; <strong>Participation</strong>. This involves a commitment to allowing public <em>contributions</em> to the dialogue. It's the holy grail of online democracy, and seems to be one of the driving motivations of this "National Dialogue"site. "We" don't know how to organize the dialogue yet, but we know that the Web offers a tremendous opportunity to build great tools.</p>
<p>My recommended solution is a strategy called <em>coalescent bubbling</em>. It goes far beyond the tag-linking and Digg-like bubbling approach
they're encouraging here, by separating the nomination phase from the
voting phase, and then using interactive ballots with a ranked-choice voting system to build consensus outcomes. The upshot of coalescent bubbling is essentially a visualization of an Instant Runoff Vote.</p>
<p>See an example at <a class="external-link" href="http://www.choiceranker.com/election.php?eid=6">http://www.choiceranker.com/election.php?eid=6</a></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>If Govt 2.0 -styled mechanisms such as Online Town Halls are going to scale to serve the demands of large and actively-engaged populations, the new venues need to built around structures that can simultaneously capture and vet new ideas, and bubble up the good ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A system (like the one on this site) designed to float popular ideas "up,"&nbsp; based on a range of&nbsp; "Like" vs "Dislike" responses, is far from optimal. Popular ideas typically get checked out first, and then bubble up even faster. Voters tend to ignore potentially valuable latecomer contributions, leaving them ever farther behind.</p>
<p>Such Town Halls also need ways to channel "swarms" (online groups of voters and contributors organized around a single candidate or issue) without degrading or silencing them. People want to compel politicians and government officials to listen to their concerns and to respond to them (which is one of the reasons "Joe the Plumber" touched such a big nerve on the right). A legitimate online Town Hall worthy of the name would provide a reliable way for citizens to do so.&nbsp; But the officials also need ways to say, politely but truthfully, "I already answered that question at&nbsp; www.answered.here."</p>
<p>The next generation of ranked choice voting systems offers many advantages in solving these problems.</p>

<p>If we want people to care, we must support their ability to participate by making it easier to do so. You shouldn't have to be a Political Science major with no other job to parcipate in government.</p>

<p>This also ties into another idea I posted, which is that if data is going to be shared as fact we need to consider the validity and who (dis)agrees with it.</p>

<p>The critique of existing internet voting techniques like tag-linking and bubbling up is valid, but I'm afraid choice-ranking would suppress participation. Still, its results are more valid than digging. It does make every vote count.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The challenge is primarily a matter of buiding a quality interface. I'm aware of a study by Google indicating that, when asked to fill out web-based surveys, the slower loading speed of a page is far more distressing to users than a higher number of options... something the creators of this site should keep in mind.</p>

				Free or low cost healthcare?

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Why aren't you making it a priority to control the costs before you talk about the working people (who pay for it all by the way) and then talk about giving it when absolutly needed only...not free and all consuming like medicade and medicare are now. I have insurance through my husband and we pay out the hind end for it and keep paying.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Important because we don't want to pay more, we are paying enough now and it keeps goping up. Why should I pay more so that someone who isn't working and many who won't work have it at no cost....the hospitals are run amuck with taking advantage of this and the government just ignores the taxpaying working man. Not right!!!!</p>

<p>No, I would rather pay my own way and give up the dinners out and cook at home, etc than take from my fellow tax-payers.

Thriving stores and local businesses help define the character of urban neighborhoods and provide numerous jobs to local residents. Today, the District of Columbia is enjoying a resurgence of economic vitality that is creating new opportunities for residents. The number of home purchases is rising, home values are appreciating, and new retail establishments are opening downtown and in communities around this area.&nbsp;

<pre>According to the neighborhood info’s study, Washington, DC has a great deal to offer businesses as the nation's capital "home to the federal government and a large tourist industry" and for its location near a booming technology industry in northern Virginia.

<pre>Overall, the Washington area's retail sales rank among the top 10 in the country. Washington, DC currently has over 5,000 retail establishments and 62,155 retail employees. Nearly one third (31.5 percent) of the retail establishments in the District are eating places, by far the largest retail category. Grocery stores make up the second largest retail category, followed by miscellaneous retail and liquor stores. The District's population is only 12 percent of the region's total and has declined nearly 6 percent since 1990. Over the past few years certain DC neighborhoods have seen a dramatic increase in retail development. This rise can be attributed to a strong economy since early 2000, a new interest in urban retail development, and the District government's attention to retail development.</pre>

<p>Even though the District of Columbia has an interest in the development of young children, there are not enough child development centers to support the need.&nbsp; In Ward 4 in the Brightwood community where the daycare center is located, forty-nine (49%) of the births are to single mothers.&nbsp; Children born to single parent families are more likely to live in poverty and in the District of Columbia, seventeen percent (17%) of the infants and toddlers are low-income, nine percent (9%) are poor, and twenty-two percent (22%) are extremely poor.&nbsp; To be more specific, nineteen percent (19%) of the children younger than five (5) years of age living in Ward 4 are living below the poverty level.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>If this cycle of poverty is to be broken in the Brightwood community, then mechanisms must be made available for families and specifically single mothers to acquire the training and the skills to find employment.&nbsp; But, single parents will find the task almost impossible without adequate care for their children as they work to prepare for a labor market that requires more and more sophisticated levels of vocational competencies.</p>

<p>I think the program has many solid points and&nbsp;offers a well thought out plan to reach out to both individuals as well as businesses. The citizens of a state with such a program would benefit to such a program in addition to the local employment offices which are inundated at this time.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see how the proposal is recieved by the governors, I hope they give the proposal the consideration is deserves.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>
				Middleware: Virtual Linked Data
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>For middleware for recovery.gov to produce linked data, there are basically two architectures.&nbsp; You either copy/map/transform each data source into one big triplestore, or you map dynamically on request. The latter you can call virtual linked data -- there are no linked data files actually on a disk, but every time a request is made, either a fetch of data or a remote query, the request is transformed into SQL queries on the underlying databases.</p>
<p><a class="external-link" href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/diagrams/sw-arch-merged.png"><img class="image-inline image-inline" src="swarchmerged.png/image_preview" alt="Virtual Linked Data" /></a> diagram</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The Virtual Linked Data approach means that no copies of the data are made. You save disk space. You don't have to worry about the linked data getting out of step with the original data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also means that the underlying databases run unmodified.&nbsp; They, and the systems and the people which manage them, can continue without having to change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Downsides may be the increased load on the original servers, so for high volume you may want to go with the triplestore approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
There are a number of open source products which do this mapping.&nbsp; <a class="external-link" href="http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/d2r-server/">D2RServer</a>
<p> was one of the first: it works with a mapping file, and has a program to generate an initial mapping file directly from the database schema. It provides both virtual linked data and a SPARQL service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a class="external-link" href="http://triplify.org/Overview">Triplify</a>
<p> is another. This has a language in which you write the template SQL query which will be made when each sort of request comes in.&nbsp; Triplyfy configuration files can be shared, hacked and remixed, by those using similar database schemas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's just two example, apologies for many omissions!</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>In any large organization (public or private) it is only natural for people to maximize the spending of their budgets. This implicitly justifies the budget. There is no incentive to save money. At the end of the fiscal year everyone rushes about to spend spend spend. This happens in both the private and public sectors although it's probably worse in the public sector. The idea is to incentivize employees to save money but simply rewarding them with some percentage or flat fee award of the money they return to the treasury or their various agencies.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Has the potential to save many millions of dollars, in a simple effective way.</p>

<p>Well the problem occurs as the fiscal year comes to a close. So let's say that 60 days before the end of the year a projection is made on anticipated dollars to be spent. Individuals can volunteer to NOT spend money they have. Of course "having money" is relative as there is a management chain that must approve expenditures. A staff memeber, group leaver, division chief and up the chain has greater and greater monetary responsibility and greater potential incentive but it would not be fair, for example, for a division cheif to hold back money to get a reward thus stopping staff from volunteering to not spend money. It would certainly get complicated, but a way to mitigate that is to put a cap on money to not spend. You want to move this process as far down the mangement chain to the staff themselves to be successful.</p>

<p>The actual incentives could be a combination of actual cash in someone's pocket, and/or a percentage added to a group or division's budget the following year, or better yet additional leave time or educational benefits. I do think the key to doing this successfully is to have a few simple rules. Coming up with them is not trivial but is clearly doable.</p>

<h1>
				Standards Always Win: An Enterprise Architecture Pattern for Transparency
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>To create a enterprise architecture pattern based upon well established industry best practices for the sharing of enterprise data across functional and organizational boundaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other industries have achieved, with great success, the standards process required to share fiscal data across enterprise boundaries.&nbsp; We have no need to reinvent the wheel with Recovery.Gov.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
We need to simply leverage the work already in place for the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.oagi.org">Open Applications Group</a>, <a class="external-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN/EDIFACT">UN/EDIFACT</a> and <a class="external-link" href="http://xbrl.org/">XBRL</a>
<p> working groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A significant amount of the data we require to provide true transparency lies deep within the Enterprise Resource Management systems deployed across State, Local and Federal agencies. To truly address the core issues of transparency we need to provide a standards based infrastructure to the seamless exchange fiscal data between all stakeholders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve this level of transparency we simply need to embrace and adhere to a small number of open standards.&nbsp; Foremost among them being the use of XBRL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a notional architecture for exchanging enterprise resource data across open internet standards in use by global supply chains today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>I'm not proposing a radical new infrastructure for transparency. Instead, I'm suggesting we simply leverage the current established standards in use for global commerce today.</p>

				Program Management and Transparency of Reinvestment Dollars
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>CapEx Manager is a market tested solutions that will allow the Federal Government to reach its goal of full transparency and accountability as the&nbsp;American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is carried out across the county. The system is particularly suited to the management of capital infrastructure programs.&nbsp; However, not matter what the expenditure may be targeted for, the software will allow each participating organization to effectively manage day-to-day operations throughout their entire Program Lifecycle.&nbsp; Data flows seamlessly between each phase of the program, from bid preparation, to procurement, through&nbsp;project management, to project closeout.&nbsp;The system enables issues to be managed and resolved as they surface, information to be viewed,&nbsp;and costs and schedules&nbsp;to be controlled.&nbsp; Through the course of each project, the public entity responsible for the project, the federal government, and citizens will have real-time views on how their project is progressing, where issues exist and what is being done to&nbsp;make certain the project is being delivered in an appropriate manner.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This type of solution is extremely important. As identified by the act itself, there is a requirement for full transparency of all expenditures of dollars that fund this initiative.&nbsp; Taxpayers must be able to know how, when, and where there tax dollars are being spent.&nbsp; Those spending the dollars must also have the tools to adequately manage the projects being funded.</p>

<h1>
				Use Annual Imagery to Track Success (IFTN)
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p class="section1">Everyone in the world understands before and after images.&nbsp;Elected office holders, citizens, agencies and news media can drown in a sea of tabular information, but a picture is worth a thousand words in any language. A national program of annual imagery, combined with geospatial data about where stimulus funds are spent, could clearly show progress over time in the rebuilding of our national infrastructure. And it would allow citizens to check on the progress of local projects.</p>
<p class="section1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="section1">For example, recovery funds were provided to&nbsp;the government of Hometown, USA for a new bridge.&nbsp; Two years later, new imagery shows the completed bridge and taxpayers from around the nation, and not just from Hometown,&nbsp;can see&nbsp;the benefits of their investment. Or they might spot a place where&nbsp;no work&nbsp;has&nbsp;been done.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Little Red Elementary School, in Hometown, gets recovery funds to install solar&nbsp;panels, the next year's imagery could reveal those panels up on the roof.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the state gets recovery funds to widen two miles of highway that lead to Hometown, a future&nbsp;aerial photo shows the highway has been widened, and&nbsp;folks can measure the new lanes.</p>
<p class="section1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="section1">The state of Arkansas has demonstrated how regular acquired imagery can quickly show a project's progress. Images over time from the area of Little Rock redeveloped for the Clinton Presidential Library offer a prime example. The images are part of a slide show presentation found at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qVct_RjdCU"><u>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qVct_RjdCU</u></a>.</p>
<p class="section1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="section1">And, while no shovels are involved, the nation is ready right now to start collecting imagery each year. The states, federal government, and private sector have come together to develop a national program, "Imagery for the Nation. It simply needs to be funded (See <a href="http://www.nsgic.org/hottopics/imageryforthenation.cfm"><u>http://www.nsgic.org/hottopics/imageryforthenation.cfm</u></a>).</p>
<p class="section1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="section1">Finally, imagery collected on an annual cycle has inherent value beyond&nbsp;the tracking&nbsp;of recovery investments.&nbsp; It can be used for public, private and non-profit decision making,&nbsp;to help save lives,&nbsp;to showcase economic development opportunities, and&nbsp;to record the history of our land.</p>

<p>More importantly, this would be a huge resource to a very broad spectrum of the public and private sectors. The range of uses for aerial photography is virtually limitless as, if kept current, it is the ultimate base reference or background layer for data collection and visualization. The economy of scale cost savings by contracting for imagery for the whole country would be very significant. If such an imagery program was conducted on a regular schedule, state and local government could realize large budget savings that could be applied to other areas of need.</p>

				Interoperable data enabling "System of Systems"
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Utilize the tremendous work done by OASIS, NOAA, NIEM and other organizations that have driven interoperable data standards to widespread use.&nbsp; Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is an alerting standard that allows for a broad range of use for informing WHAT happened, WHERE it happened, WHEN it happened, and WHO reported it.&nbsp; Recovery.gov could immediately start putting out location specific information about job creation, contract awards, and a host of other real time events.&nbsp; This could be done using CAP today, and quickly augmented with additional, standardized, structured transactions that would allow multiple sytems to consume and utilize the information.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The DATA will be around for 100 years!&nbsp; The tools won't last 10 years.&nbsp; Make sure the base data is in a form that is reusable, consumable, understandable, and not applications specific.&nbsp; This will allow a broad base of tools to work with the data for many different purposes.</p>

				Transparency lessons from New York City
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The taxpayers are in need of clear, concise and accurate reporting.&nbsp;One&nbsp;of the leading web sites for reporting stimulus dollars is hosted by the City of New York. This web site called <a class="external-link" href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/ops/nycstim/html/tracker/infrastructure.shtml">NYCStat</a>&nbsp;gives taxpayers a clear view into what is being spent, how much is being spent and where it&nbsp;is being spent. You can drill in to a program and clearly see&nbsp;what the&nbsp;programs status is at any point in time.&nbsp;This is a simple way to let taxpayers see projects that impact their local and identify project status. In addition, another way for a taxpayer get access to project details and status is to allow them to&nbsp;drill into a&nbsp;state, then in to the county or&nbsp;city. There are numerous ways to integrate geospatial data with project/program data.&nbsp;Incorporating geospatial data provides a rich interface to program and project data.&nbsp;</p>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></div>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This allows the taxpayer to have centralized access to detail program and project within their local. The taxpayer is interested in&nbsp;rich content, simple terminology that is free from government jargon, and clear concise&nbsp;information. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				Location Schema- Enables Data Analysis and Visualization 
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The National States Geographic Information Council (NSGIC) applauds the focus in this Dialogue on using data visualization tools such as maps -- and the GIS tools that make geospatial data useful to the public as maps and other information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We offer a few thoughts on how to make sure that we make the best use of geospatial data and GIS to ensure the citizens have complete information on where and how their dollars are spent. The most critical step that must be taken is to provide a standard, nationally consistent approach to tracking where stimulus funds are spent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest a hierarchy of commonly used geospatial location attributes that can be used to mark discrete points, collections of points, or areas in which funds are spent:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Latitude/Longitude -- For spending tied to a particular spot or point feature</li><li>Mileposts (Linear Referencing) -- For spending on transportation infrastructure</li><li>Address -- For spending tied to a particular building</li><li>Unique Parcel Identification Number -- For spending tied to&nbsp;a particular property</li><li>Census Blocks/Block Groups/Tracts -- For spending in a geographic area</li><li>Zip Code --&nbsp;For spending in a slightly larger geographic area</li><li>Legislative District (State or Congressional) -- For spending in an even&nbsp;larger geographic area</li><li>City/County/State -- For spending in general within a defined administrative boundary</li></ul>
<p>Establishing a common ‘location schema’ is critical.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>A common location schema, understood and used by all reporting&nbsp;ARRA funds;&nbsp;will be required in order to obtain the integration with the visualization tools proposed.</p>

<p>In reviewing the focus of your groups efforts, we would hope that you are sharing this information with the Department of Commerce, and its many agenies, such as Census, Patent Office, Minority Business Administration, Economic Development Administrations, International Trade Administration, Export Office, NOAA, etc., each of which would benefit from such a large data collection interprise. With that data collections interprise, what a great possibility to&nbsp;lift the level of information collected and shared. But that is what it is all about, bringing the giant pools of information into a single compilation of useful information, able to share with industry and individuals. After all, Commerce could make better forcast of resources needed to stimulate industry, imports/exports, cosummer demands, as well as forcast the demand for financial resources, and not just depend on the fancy of Wall Street, which seems to be&nbsp;only interested in&nbsp;receeding profit margins.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Incorporate Social Enablement in Transparency Paradigm
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Social Enablement consists of architecting, developing, and ultimately using a network of transparency services along with developing the social context within government to encourage its maximum utilization. Social Enablement as a strategic element assures that transparency gains sufficient reach and capacity to be meaningful to citizens of all interests and degrees of technical savvy.</p>
<p>At its core is the assertion that answering only the questions asked does not effect real transparency. Real transparency arises when two parties commit to not only answer what's asked but also offer what information one party feels the other might like or need to know.</p>
<p>A Network of Transparency Services</p>
<p>Open, accessible data&nbsp;fulfills only part of the transparency imperative. "Pullable" data (if I may coin the term for this context) serves only the portion of the population&nbsp;who have&nbsp;the technical know-how to discover, manipulate, and interpret what can be fairly sophisticated information AND the impetus to do so - which comes at an appreciable cost of personal time and effort.&nbsp; Certainly others will take note of what such members of the technorati&nbsp; achieve and conclude, but even then the transparency effect is limited to the intersection of one group's technical competence and the other's mutual interest in the areas to which it's been applied.&nbsp; When you consider the diversity of interests to be addressed by the ARRA monies, it becomes apparent that the "long tail" of citizenry, the many who have a stake in some local interest but not the know-how to answer their own questions from the raw data provided, go underserved. Social Enablement recognizes instead the need for a network of transparency services that facilitate&nbsp;the push and pull of data between the government and the citizenry along with the means for a self-serving community to bridge gaps wherein the information is not pushed and the interested party's lacks the ability to pull it .</p>
<p>"Pulled" Transparency Services</p>
<p>Pulled transparency services include all the means by which data is made available to citizens. Many of the ideas already posted on this site address very specific means, whether through mash-ups, open API's, adoption of particular standards, etc., by which pulled services can be enabled. They deserve examination in their own right.&nbsp;That we do not discuss them here should not imply a lesser importance. They are an equal necessity to effecting real transparency through Social Enablement.</p>
<p>Pulled services empower those with the interest and know-how to answer questions about ARRA expenditures that they formulate themselves. It provides tremendous insight to both the technically literate who interact with the data directly as well as members of their particularly audience or others who share a common interest in the ARRA expenditure examined.</p>
<p>"Pushed" Transparency Services</p>
<p>Pushed transparency services are the means by which government publishes information and analysis regarding ARRA activities.&nbsp;Pushed transparency reaches those members of the citizenry without the know-how or impetus to formulate questions about&nbsp;ARRA data, those with the impetus but not the know-how whose interests are not shared by someone who does possess the know-how, or those who may be unaware of their stake in an ARRA project.&nbsp;Our concept of social enablement considers this population likely to dramatically outnumber those served directly by pulled transparency services; they are essentially the Federal CIO Vivek Kundra recently asserted that the government needs to promote access to services where and when citizens spend their time online.&nbsp; The same can be said of transparency services - it is incumbent on the government to&nbsp;place ARRA data and news where and when the citizens are best apt to discover it.</p>
<p>As part of Social Enablement, we advocate strategically identifying and incorporating those channels to which a particular stakeholder community pays attention then publishing information and analysis along those channels.&nbsp; Channels to be considered should include popular social networks, micro-blogging, online news outlets, and blogs as well as traditional print or television media.&nbsp; Each should be employed where relevant and accessible to a particular project's stakeholder community. Kundra declared, "Access to government services should be just another component in a seamless digital experience.”&nbsp; We couldn't agree more, nor could the point be more relevant that in the government's strategic positioning of ARRA disclosures.</p>
<p>Community Services</p>
<p>Community transparency services provide the means for those with interest and impetus but not know-how to connect with those with the know-how who might bridge the cap between the former citizen's question and the answer in data made accessible by the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens with highly focused interests, particularly those related to small or local projects may find a shortage of others with&nbsp;similar interest and the know-how to&nbsp;derive answers. A community forum&nbsp;over which such citizens could solicit assistance from other citizens who may&nbsp;not share the interest&nbsp;but are willing to lend their technical ability to&nbsp;find the&nbsp;other answers would ensure that transparency has a vehicle for&nbsp;reaching even the most distant corners of&nbsp;the population.&nbsp;A model for&nbsp;empowering such community&nbsp;can be inferred from the development communities&nbsp;many software&nbsp;vendors use to connect users who identify&nbsp;new functionality with developers who can implement it.</p>
<p>Community transparency services also carry the potential for a beneficial side effect:&nbsp;we&nbsp;just may find that marrying one citizen's need for technical know-how to another citizen's ability also further fosters community among&nbsp;American citizens with&nbsp;diverse interests and perspectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Context for Network Utilization</p>
<p>All of the above amounts to one tremendous vehicle for transparency in America but ultimately idles and goes nowhere without able and willing drivers to pilot it. Social Enablement calls not just for the mechanisms to push and pull transparency but also for developing the context that encourages their utilization.&nbsp;It has been offered lately that to derive greatest benefit from collaborative technologies organizations need evolve from "need to know" to "need to share" postures regarding information. Though spoken simply, those words have deep implications for the sort of cultural changes necessary to fulfill them.</p>
<p>Understanding the citizenry, too, as a community of stakeholders in ARRA projects is a concept worth exploring. Developing skills in stakeholder assessment could help shape the context for identifying the audience for an ARRA project and the means to reach them with transparency services.</p>
<p>Nudging government employees so akin to compartmentalization toward better openness and communication demands strategic consideration and plain old work. Those to whom the means for Social Enablement will be available will need to understand how, when, and why to use them.&nbsp; In short, education and training in the nuances of social media and other tools must be undertaken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Effecting real and apparent transparency across the breadth of a diverse citizenry requires more than mere access to data. We must ascribe equal importance to developing, supporting, and using social mechanisms for maintaining the flow of that data between its producers and consumers. Unless the means and the social context are both developed, transparency will stagnate and under serve the citizen.</p>

<p>Very thoughtful.&nbsp; We really need to think about how the data is likely to be used - it will presumably range from the merely curious to firms using it for selling to the government and other firms selling to users.&nbsp; I don't want to declare any of that as nefarious, but putting together some use cases (informed by real potential users) would help us to better understand what we're getting into.</p>

<h1>
				Ensure the Recovery reporting solution achieves Agency mission objectives
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>To be most effective, Federal Agencies need a quick and easy reporting solution to interface with and be compliant with the requirements for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), while continuing to serve their important missions. Based on experience working with every Federal Agency and leveraging the expertise across all Agencies, transforming the ARRA package reporting and data collection processes will be a real “Recovery” challenge for these individual Agencies. A change to reporting requirements will force a ripple effect within the Agencies themselves. They must adjust process, data and report formats, and review cycles, which may disrupt their mission focus. Therefore, the “Recovery” solution must ensure that Agencies be able to integrate with OMB and meet the necessary requirements through the use of &nbsp;technology that coordinates with existing Agency frameworks and meets&nbsp; Agencies’ IT modernization objectives.</p>
<p>To provide a fast, efficient, cost-effective, scalable, and easy-to-maintain reporting solution, the Recovery Team may want to consider the following.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Be the catalyst for Agency change:</strong> Consider solutions that focus on clean source data and the use of advanced data aggregation techniques (such as mashups) to produce open services.&nbsp; When incorporated into pre-existing data stores and workflow solutions throughout the Agencies (such as Intranet Quorum), these open services integrate nicely into the social networking and workflow environment. Agencies will have an opportunity to easily leverage the data availability and open service approach to transform and modernize internal and external business processes.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Learn from constituents:</strong> The social networking innovations are evolutions of consumer market tools. The “Recovery” reporting solution should leverage the benefits of these innovations, especially constituent interactions. The real difference will be to leverage a social networking platform that is not constrained by proprietary application programming interfaces (APIs). The platform should be an extensible cost-effective social media platform.&nbsp; Using an open standard such as OpenSocial powered by an open source implementation (Apache Shindig) can eliminate licensing restrictions and cost issues encountered in the past.<strong></strong></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Leverage Open Source:</strong>&nbsp; Open Source software can provide better quality, higher reliability, more flexibility, lower cost, and an end to vendor lock-in, which makes the government dependent on a vendor for products and services, and unable to use another product without substantial costs.&nbsp; The Open Source business model is a way of solving customer problems in a very effective way, both from a control and an economic perspective.&nbsp; Open Source harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process.&nbsp; Many Agencies are pursuing this philosophy for standard infrastructure products.&nbsp; The Recovery team should consider the use of Open Source where a strong central manager is leading the Open Source product effort and a large community exists.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Allow multiple data-input formats:</strong> While many Agencies will adjust their reporting interfaces and technical capabilities, the reporting function within Recovery.gov should be highly flexible. The Recovery team should consider the use of anything from RSS feeds (which exist in multiple Agencies today and are produced using open standards) to file uploads. At a minimum, the data-input should be in an electronic format that can be read and ingested for quick monitoring and problem identification.&nbsp; Ideally, the solution would consume services generated by mashups using clean data as described above. OMB may configure the mashup service to throw flags against thresholds and route the services using the same standard workflow tools. This process also improves monitoring of objectives, plans, and actual data to create a robust performance monitoring tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Federal Agencies need a quick and easy means to interface with and be compliant with the Stimulus requirements, while serving their current mission. The combination of open standards, mashups, clean data, and existing workflow tools marries innovation with a fast and efficient deployment—without integrating expansive COTS packages with lengthy configuration timelines. This solution offers robust monitoring to detect and correct improper behavior. Lastly, it is easy to administer, requires minimal customization, and is highly scalable for Agency modernization efforts.</p>
<p>Our experience with Federal Agencies has taught us to transform and modernize solutions that will add value to the mission of that Agency. This solution is not only critical to each individual Agency, but essential to the mission of our Federal Government and the ultimate success of our country’s economic recovery.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				Expose data in existing systems, link them, encourage their use
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Many agencies already have systems to manage how they spend funds.&nbsp; For example, most state transportation departments use a common system from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to manage estimating, bidding, and progress tracking and payments for infrastructure construction&nbsp; projects. &nbsp;Many similar systems have been internally developed or are commercially available, and are used to similar purpose by all kinds of agencies, so a lot of stimulus funds are going to be managed using these systems.<br />
<br />
First, ask those system vendors and users to provide a way to publish at least some important information from them to websites open to the public. &nbsp;Some of the systems can already do this, and it's a reasonable feature to ask of all of them.<br />
<br />
Second, link the systems by having them automatically "register" the availability of information on new projects with some central clearinghouse. &nbsp;Keep this extremely simple: something like filling out a simple form with a small amount of important information (project description, budget, schedule, agency) and a link to the public web site with deeper data. &nbsp;This clearinghouse will serve as a publicly available directory of available information and a basic search engine.<br />
<br />
Finally, encourage all stimulus fund recipients to use such a system.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This effort can begin quickly, fed by systems already in use, and grow in completeness incrementally with low cost. &nbsp;As it becomes more widespread, more public associations and commercial vendors will offer more kinds of solutions, making it easier and less expensive for smaller agencies to participate. &nbsp;At first the detailed information would be presented in different ways by different systems, but over time they would likely converge on more common formats and presentation.<br />
<br />
Once the central clearinghouse begins to be used other entities (such as watchdog groups and search engines) can use it as a starting point for them to collect and sift through the available detailed data, and extract and present information gleaned by doing so.<br />
<br />
The public will have faster and fuller access to data on how funds are being spent, anyone with a good idea on using that data can do so even in ways we can't now anticipate, this can start almost immediately at low cost, and it has the potential to grow organically to cover an ever greater percentage of stimulus projects.</p>

<p>I think the fact that the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)&nbsp;has taken the leadership role in developing transportation program management systems that are deployed in some 42 of the 50 states DOTs should be capitalized upon and become a center piece in the ARRA reporting process.&nbsp; Since there is a common electronic system already in place, it should simply be a matter of defining the reporting requirements and having these systems produce the reports.</p>

<h1>
				End-to-End Process and Tools Ensure Transparency and Quality
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Adopt and end-to-end process and set of software tools to support and automate that process to enable predictability, visibility, and transparency on IT projects. Improved quality (functionality/performance, cost, and schedule) will result.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>In opening this National Dialogue, Mr. Devaney and Mr.
DeSeve talk about ensuring <strong>transparency and accountability </strong>in the dialogue and
in the acquisition of information technology. We've also heard of the goal of
transparent sourcing and creation of IT systems. "Robust monitoring"
Mr. DeSeve calls it. These ideas are in line with commercial best practices:
implement processes and tools so that program mangers have real visibility of
current status. I have noticed that not only do predictability and effective
program communication increase, but quality does as well. Delivered systems
meet real citizen needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can incorporate the American public in the building of our
systems. This is consistent with the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment/">President's open government memorandum</a>.
User feedback on the needs of systems that pay social security checks, deliver
veteran benefits, and offer electronic health alerts will make those systems
better. A <strong>change management </strong>process and change tools will make this work.
<strong>Requirements </strong>and <strong>testing</strong> tools will ensure that the systems meet real stakeholder
needs and avoid tax-dollar waste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I work for the software division of IBM,
and based on my experience I would like to propose that these programs adopt an
end-to-end process including software tools to make the creation and delivery
of IT systems transparent. <strong>Enterprise
architecture </strong>and <strong>program planning </strong>tools are critical for system design and laying
out an organization's IT topology. The heavy lifting occurs when commercial
parts are sourced or software is written. This is where the bulk of a system's
requirements are met, and where transparency and predictability goals often
fall short. Citizens, program managers, and the development team can all
participate in the optimal construction of an IT asset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Software tools are an important part of that end-to-end process. Tools
will automate many aspects of the process, such as analyzing the impact of
change, regression testing, and building and deploying the software system.
Tools will also ensure conformance to the design and deployment process, and
enable visibility and accountability without placing a burden of reporting on
the part of the doers. Status and progress are based on executable
functionality and meaningful metrics derived from federal IT assets themselves including requirements implemented, outstanding
defects, and tests passed. Insight is not gained from subjective status
reports and documents created solely for the purpose of reporting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My part of IBM develops tools and best practices for
teams to use. I invite further dialogue on how we can achieve these objectives on a project basis as well as looking at an agency's entire IT portfolio. The <a class="external-link" href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/info/developer/solutions/gov/index.jsp">IBM
Rational government web page</a> offers more depth on these concepts. Articles at the bottom of the page demonstrate some of the ways program managers can improve the economics behind software development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am happy to help and welcome further contact and dialogue.</p>

<p>Scott,</p>
Scott,
<p>I agree with your statements that every project needs an end to end map of all processes.&nbsp; You are correct that this is critical to every change that is associated with all IT projects. &nbsp;In order to associate these processes with accountability and traceability I believe it even more important that during the design phases of the processes to be able to develop the distinct key operating indicators for the following the areas; Program Performance, Process / System Performance and Human / Interface Performance and possibly others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I believe it is most important to define these during the development of the processes with clear and precise definitions as to keep the requirement development process streamlined.&nbsp; This specifically focuses on how the accountability and transparency can be passed to all contractors. &nbsp;&nbsp;So, to that point the federal government might want to focus on defining indicators that hold contractors accountable in order to streamline the RFP phase of the projects. There is a good public resource at <a href="http://kpilibrary.com/"><u>http://kpilibrary.com/</u></a> that can be referenced.&nbsp; These can be used as scorecards for contractors.</p>

				Palantir: Technology to Empower people to Investigate and Prevent Fraud
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Please see <a href="http://www.palantirtech.com/videos/stimulus">this video Demonstration of our idea in practice</a>!</p>
<p>Investigators on the Recovery Act Accountability and Transparency Board (RAT Board) will need to draw on vast quantities of data while performing their duties to investigate and prevent fraud, waste and abuse in stimulus spending.  Since human resources are always limited it is important to empower analysts and investigators so that they can be effective as possible.  <a href="http://www.palantirtech.com">Palantir</a> enables analysts to rapidly visualize and understand the non-obvious relationships present in data to create a coherent and accurate view of the world.</p>
<p>Palantir has addressed the significant technology challenges that must be addressed before analysis can take place.  The stimulus data exists in a wide variety of locations and formats – both structured (database, xml, spreadsheets) and unstructured (free text) - and this data is arriving in real time.  Any meaningful analysis will take place in an integrated environment and allow investigators with different areas of specialization to collaborate in this constantly evolving space.  Palantir enables new data to be incorporated and integrated rapidly, without requiring all the data formats to be specified up front.  (Videos of our engineers talking about the technical challenges we’ve solved in detail, and how we solved them <a href="http://www.palantirtech.com/government/videos/whitevideos">can be found by following this link</a>)</p>
<p>Palantir has proven its ability to surmount these challenges (and very challenging security considerations, too) by empowering analysts in the allied intelligence community. Our software is available commercially, off the shelf, and it can be deployed very quickly.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the speed with which Palantir can be deployed for operational use and ingest new data sources we analyzed existing federal contract data obtained from <a href="http://usaspending.gov">usaspending.gov</a> and risk-relevant public records data provided by <a href="http://www.rdc.com">Regulatory Data Corp</a>.  RDC provided us with risk-coded, entity extracted data - this makes it possible to rapidly identify the risk-characteristics of individuals and corporations.  We created a video of our analysis.  During our analysis we identified contractors that had billed for duplicate transactions as well as awards to contractors that committed fraud/violated FCPA prior to winning contracts.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="http://www.palantirtech.com/videos/stimulus">this video Demonstration of our idea in practice</a>!</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Only a human can identify fraud, waste and abuse.  Automated checks and machine heuristics are useful, but fraudsters learn rapidly how to get around such systems.  The expert inspectors on the RAT board must have the best technology at their fingertips so that they can be as effective as possible.</p>
<p>An audit trail and knowledge management is crucial so that RAT board itself can be accountable to the public.  To this end, Palantir tracks the steps and actions of every analyst using it.</p>
<p>Palantir is focused on applying technology to enable transparency in the context of <a href="http://www.palantirtech.com/government/regulation">regulation and oversight</a> and we are excited to be participating in the town hall.</p>
<p>Interested parties may also want to take a look at some other examples of our platform in action.</p>

<p>Personally, i think they should use ASP.Net and Silverlight to build a compelling web portal. then they can surface real data and make sure to proivide dynamic information to the public. As information changes, they can simply update the data and flow it through the portal. Plus they can push out multi media as needed to further convey information.</p>

				Stakeholder mapping
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The idea is to implement a stakeholder mapping system with the currently available CMS components (taxonomy, CCK, and views, etc.) in the <a class="external-link" href="http://recovery.gov">recovery.gov</a> website so that the same raw data source can be viewed and analyzed from the perspectives of different stakeholders.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The stakeholder theory is a theory of organizational management and business ethics that addresses morals and values in managing an organization. ... i<span class="Apple-style-span">t attempts to address the "Principle of Who or What Really Counts."&nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span">(<a class="external-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_theory">wikipedia</a>) .&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>For example, giant corporations, independent business consultants and non-profit organizations are different stakeholders that all have legitimate stakes in the recovery program. Accountability and transparency should depend on the stakes each of them holds and how they are related to other stakeholders. A pragmatic <a class="external-link" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=stakeholder+mapping">stakeholder mapping</a> system could help people get a better view of the complex network of stakeholders so that they can make their own judgement.</p>
<p>I am sure there are many management science experts here who are familiar with stakeholder analysis so I would be more than happy to hear about their ideas. Since the&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="../search?SearchableText=stakeholder">search result</a>&nbsp;of the keyword "stakeholder" on this site does not show similar ideas, I submit it as a new idea for you to make comments and suggestions.</p>

<h1>
				Using balanced scorecards for performance-based analytics
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>One of the key imperatives of the Recovery Act is for Federal agencies to take concrete, proactive steps to ensure recipients of stimulus funds are spending the money responsibly, and in a manner that benefits taxpayers.&nbsp; With $787 billion in taxpayers' dollars flowing into the economy in a short period of time, the potential for fraud, waste, and abuse is elevated.&nbsp; It is important for the government to leverage analytic techniques that will allow officials to exercise reasonable oversight without getting bogged down in vast quantities of spending data.</p>
<p>The "Balanced Scorecard" is an example of one of these analytic techniques.&nbsp; A balanced scorecard is a performance management tool used for aligning strategic objectives to operational metrics.&nbsp; A balanced scorecard allows senior executives to rapidly identify areas of risk during execution of their strategic plan by identifying specific operational areas that are performing outside of established norms and parameters.</p>
<p>In the context of Recovery.gov, balanced scorecards can be used to provide a snapshot of prime recipient performance against desired program / economic outcomes. Each prime recipient can be scored in "green - yellow - red" fashion against a set of key performance indicators (KPI). KPIs are measures used to help an enterprise define and evaluate how successful it is.</p>
<p>In the Recovery.gov scenario, KPIs could be established for and mapped to Recovery Act Accountability Objectives established by law and policy.&nbsp; For example, one of the Recovery Act Accountability Objectives defined in OMB Memorandum 09-15 is entitled "Program Outcomes and Economic Outcomes Achieved." Since a key economic outcome of the ARRA is job creation, a KPI could be established to measure cost per job creation.&nbsp; Any grant program or recipient with an excessive cost per job creation could be identified through a balanced scorecard, and could then receive the appropriate level of management and oversight.</p>
<p>Within Recovery.gov, balanced scorecards could be created to evaluate agency, program, and prime recipient performance.&nbsp; One could also create a balanced scorecard to look at stimulus performance on a per-state basis, to ensure fair distribution and use of stimulus funds on a geographic basis. Of course, once scorecard KPIs are established, data collection protocols might need to be tweaked to ensure sufficient data are being collected to support the analytics implemented by the scorecard.</p>
<p>There are numerous technologies, both commercial and open source, that can be used to implement the balanced scorecard features described in this article.&nbsp; For example, Unisys has developed a Recovery Act reporting solution that implements four different types of "accountability scorecards:" Recipient scorecard, program scorecard, state scorecard, and agency scorecard. The Unisys Recovery Act reporting solution was developed using various open source technologies, and is designed to integrate well with Government web hosting environments.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The amount of information (data)&nbsp;that will need to be managed, transferred between various applications &amp; platforms, archived, queried, etc. should be based on standards such as the SNIA's eXtensible access method (XAM) <a href="http://www.snia.org/forums/xam">http://www.snia.org/forums/xam</a>.&nbsp;SNIA's XAM provides a standard way for providing the below solutions:</p>

<p>XAM doesn't standardize the metadata for health records itself, but supports the maintenance and search of that metadata. There has been some work standardizing Health resources metadata already (see: http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=61461).</p>

<p>XAM would be a great foundation for this other work as it standardizes the storage aspects such as how long to retain the records, what happens at the end of the period, etc. Also, by standardizing an inport/export format, XAM allows you to move those records from vendor to vendor whithout getting locked in.</p>

<p>I would take this a step further. Recognizing this site was put up quickly and for a limited duration, it is not my intent to offend the authors. However, this site should not be used as a model for the colaboration expected&nbsp;though Recovery.Gov. It looks nice at first glance, but it eats up so much real estate that it becomes increasingly frustrating to navigate and find ideas worthy of analysis and comment. Five ideas to a page and the response time of the system&nbsp;to peruse 95 pages to find ideas of interest is unnecessarily time consuming. When you get as many inputs as this site has so far, it needs a more concise presentation were the user can scroll through lists that the user can sort by area of interest/context. Next comment.. A great number of the ideas fall into the category of product advertisements by vendors or product evangelists. There should be a bit more "transparency" on the behalf of the contributors. When you're trying to sell a product, be honest and say so up front.</p>

<p>I am re-submittingn because of the moderation&nbsp;as follows;</p>
<p><strong><em>Vapsoft-based ARRA Decision Support System</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Vapsoft-based Decision Support System is recommended for business and data analysis solutions for ARRA. Vapsoft &nbsp;is &nbsp;an user computing software for data analysis and business intelligence.&nbsp; I would like to offer &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>“PROTOTYPE” </strong>information solutions for ARRA free of charge. I have already developed a “Prototype” Vapsoft application for ARRA using data from <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/"><u>www.recovery.gov</u></a> , &nbsp;<a href="http://www.usaspending.gov/"><u>www.usaspending.gov</u></a>, and websites of federal government departments. I am ready for a demo. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>The output reports of this application were published in my website at &nbsp;<a href="http://www.nonprofitsdata.com/1J_ARRA.htm"><u>http://www.nonprofitsdata.com/1J_ARRA.htm&nbsp;&nbsp; </u></a>&nbsp;This &nbsp;“Prototype” system contains ARRA Summary (26 tables –include data from <a href="http://www.usaspending.gov/"><u>www.usaspending.gov</u></a>),&nbsp; ARRA Division A (31 tables), and ARRA Division B (1 table). &nbsp;The &nbsp;proposal &nbsp;for “Prototype” &nbsp;development is recommended as follows;</em></p>
<p><strong><em><u>“Prototype” ARRA Decision Support System </u></em></strong><u></u></p>
<p>Ø&nbsp; <em>Develop Microsoft Excel-based&nbsp; formatted&nbsp; uniformed ARRA Reporting procedures.</em></p>
<p>Ø&nbsp; <em>Collect ARRA data from the Excel-based reporting&nbsp; sources and&nbsp; create and update&nbsp; ARRA DSS data bases.</em></p>
<p>Ø&nbsp; <em>Apply Vapsoft for ARRA business and data analysis.</em></p>
<p>Ø&nbsp; <em>If “Prototype” is successful, move on to a permanent solutions (ARRA Data Warehouse Solutions) </em></p>
<p><strong><em><u>&nbsp;</u></em></strong><em><u>&nbsp;</u></em><strong><em><u>ARRA D/W-based Decision Support System </u></em></strong><em><u></u></em></p>
<p>Ø&nbsp; <em>Develop ARRA data model using information collected from “Prototype”&nbsp; DSS.</em></p>
<p>Ø&nbsp; <em>Develop ARRA transaction application to collect and operate uniformed ARRA reporting data.</em></p>
<p>Ø&nbsp; <em>ARRA reporting agencies must enter their reporting data directly to the ARRA transaction system.</em></p>
<p>Ø&nbsp; <em>Develop ARRA Data Warehouse extracting ARRA transaction data daily.</em></p>
<p>Ø&nbsp; <em>Apply Vapsoft and other business analysis tools for&nbsp; business and data analysis. <br /></em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<h1>
				Add Simulation Models to Understand Interdependencies 
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Provide&nbsp;a series of&nbsp;simulations that&nbsp;model the interdependent set of critical social forces that must be kept in balance to ensure a safe, stable and prosperous America.&nbsp; Many of these forces involve feedback loops and dependencies that can be best understood using either equilibrium or game theory models.&nbsp; By linking different areas of ARRA investment (e.g. infrastructure, education, environment, etc) to an appropriate model, citizens might be able to better see the investments more holistically, and understand how each is likely to contribute in a broader fashion to the recovery.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>First and foremost, these kinds of interdependency models will make citizens more aware that they exist in a virtual ecosystem, one in which the Government’s actions can have both local and global unintended impact and consequences.&nbsp; Such knowledge transparency can allow the rise of a greater public sensitivity and deeper understanding of the needs and issues that impact local, national and global communities.&nbsp; In turn, this can bring people, from both inside and outside Government, closer together in an attempt to seek out where their most important shared interests really lie, and a better understanding of the potential unintended consequences of poorly informed, or closely held decision making. This can give focus, energy and a greater sense of urgency to Government programs that relate to or address these shared interests.</p>
<p>The awareness that they can both understand and positively impact the direction of Government and more fully understand policy and decision consequences as part of a larger interconnected ecosystem, can also be extraordinarily empowering to individual citizens. Better informed citizenry can better participate in the direction of Government, which can be guided by more informed leaders who are much more visibly accountable to the people, and who consequently make better, more balanced and informed decisions.&nbsp; This will also make it easier for our leaders to layout and communicate a practical path towards the greater good.</p>

<p>This type of analysis should provide very interesting results.&nbsp; Given the broad audience Recovery.gov will reach, it may be best to make the data available to allow users to do the analysis and then make the results and interpretation available.&nbsp; Making the results known&nbsp; could be achieved by dedicating a portion of the portal to this information, or by linking to the information.&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Certainly I agree with making the data available, but you also need to provide them the simulation models that allow you to understand interdependencies, so that they can do this kind of deeper data analysis.&nbsp; Building the models require a certain level of mathematical expertise and it would help to tap into communites that have this expertise and have built applicable or similar models.&nbsp; There's no reason you couldn't have multiple or competing models, and in fact, this could be an area that generates it's own dialogue, as I think you suggest.</p>

<p>I fully agree with this idea on the need and value of simulations for ARRA throughout its as-yet-undefined management life cycle, especially to test its as-yet-undefined management controls (excepting those already in place by law and executive order).</p>

<p>The important question is: how complete and accurate is the model whose "world view" is being simulated?&nbsp; If a model being simulated is not fully defined in terms of its internal parts, relationships, and attributes (i.e., its endeavor architecture), and in its external interfaces (i.e., value-chains), then it is a "closed-world" view that is being simulated, and thus open to all of the "surprises" coming from any pieces that are not modeled.&nbsp; Neglecting context is a classic weakness of&nbsp;"systems management" and system/software development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The way around this is to start from the top, but not with a lot of detail, naming and connecting all of the dots (e.g., via concept maps) until you get to the details of the twigs and leaves that need to be simulated.&nbsp; As analogy, start with a simple model of the world, connecting&nbsp;simple models of&nbsp;continents, each connecting simple models of their forests, each connecting simple models of their trees (i.e. an endeavor like ARRA), each connecting simple models of their brances (like a Federal Agency's ARRA-supporting program or staff function), each connecting simple models of their twigs (the processes followed by&nbsp;programs and functions), each connecting&nbsp;their leaves (the products, inputs, controls, and mechanisms of the process of the program) needing simulation.</p>

				Deeper Analytics &amp; Visualization
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Deeper analytics and richer visualization specific to the requirements set forth in the latest OMB Guidance of 4/3 and under the requirements of the Recovery Act. Federal agencies must&nbsp;be able to effectively manage the Recovery Act funds that they have been entrusted to manage and to ensure that the results attained by the investment of those funds achieve the goals set forth by the Administration. We believe a COTS solution, specifically developed for the Recovery Act requirements and can be modified for use by both Federal agencies and state and local governments achieves those goals. Please give us your feedback based on a notional demo we have created: <a href="http://www.cognos.com/solutions/industry/government/economic-recovery.html?mc=-web_hp">http://www.cognos.com/solutions/industry/government/economic-recovery.html?mc=-web_hp</a>.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>It is critical to be able to monitor and measure where those funds have been invested, report on the results achieved at a program by program level and with an aggregated view, to be able to drill down deeper into programs and use advance analytic capabilities to fully understand the impact those funds will have on stimulating local economies and creating jobs. We have developed a solution that allows both Federal government agencies disbursing funds and state and local government who are the recipients of funds to track in depth how those funds have been invested and the results they have generated to date.</p>
<p>This solution can be modified QUICKLY to meet the changing requirements and&nbsp;ties in with an overall Government Performance Management Solution.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I appreciate JWJones comment above about the urgency of the Recovery and obtaining actionable data from the effort but getting the data out there has to be the priority over any fancy dashboards, visualization, or massively architected projects. Do not under estimate the level of interest amongst the general public to analyze this data themselves. It only takes a half a dozen HOWTOs plus free software like GNU/Linux, MySQL, Apache, and php before a local geek becomes a volunteer data analyst for their town/city/county/state.</p>

<h1>
				Data Transparency, Openness, and Access
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Provide transparency into the sources of the data used for the tables/figures in all of the areas on Recovery.gov.&nbsp; This will enable site visitors to fully understand who is responsible for the information, data correctness/cleanliness, margin of error for statistical analyses, compilation date, volatility/frequency of updates, and expiration window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, all source data should be made programmatically accessible via open standard protocols and interfaces (HTTP, SOAP, REST, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the potential cost and complexity of hosting such data and managing an interface layer - and that the demand on the data sources is unknown and may need to scale significantly, I recommend using a Cloud-based platform rather than establishing a government-run IT datacenter (the data is already free and open, which can help to reduce privacy and security concerns).&nbsp; Data.gov is a good start - but the solution for Recovery.gov should focus on Recovery information, and provide API access rather than downloadable files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is launching an Open Government Data Initiative (OGDI) that will help foster the development of solutions like this hosted in Windows Azure.&nbsp; Obviously, I recommend considering the use of this initiative (or similar) and the code, technology, and guidance provided (which are free and open) to accelerate the time to market and reduce the costs for this implementation with Recovery.gov.&nbsp; More information on OGDI can be found at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/government/opengovdata"><u>http://www.microsoft.com/government/opengovdata</u></a> shortly (it is being launched next week), or send email to <a href="mailto:askogdi@microsoft.com"><u>askogdi@microsoft.com</u></a> for details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Providing this level of visibility and transparency into the data sources will help insure that the site visitors have a high level of confidence and trust in the data, and will enable them to understand when data becomes irrelevant or useless - and whom to contact for resolution if there are any problems.</p>
<p>In addition, providing open API access to the source data will aid in the direct integration with other solutions, which will extend the usefulness of the Recovery.gov site.&nbsp; Using a Cloud solution, like Windows Azure, can reduce costs vs. having to host and manage a datacenter - and can allow for extremely high scalability and availability.&nbsp; It will also help ensure government agency participation by potentially reducing their costs and simplifying their technical requirements for publishing data and information.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this concept will enable developers using any technology, such as .NET, Java, Flash, Silverlight, PHP, etc,&nbsp; to use the Recovery information to build a broad array of innovative solutions, mash-ups, data visualizations, etc. that would be challenging for the Recovery.gov developers to envision or develop themselves.&nbsp; Recovery.gov will get the collective benefit of a huge audience of developers and experts on analyzing and understanding the recovery data, which will help to make the site and data more useful to the public.</p>

<p>I disagree about the comment regarding Cloud vendors potentially limiting access - since they are public entities, they really have no incentive to do so, and such a thing would seriously damage their business model (i.e., their customers would react very badly if Microsoft, Google, Amazon, or any of the other Cloud vendors were found to be controlling access to information).&nbsp; It's in the Cloud vendor's best interest to keep the data as free and available as possible.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				KISS with geospatial information
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I've read through several ideas on The National Dialogue and have been very impressed by energy and enthusiasm of people willing to contribute.&nbsp; My interests are in geospatial information and web development.&nbsp; So, I'd like to propose a simple idea that I haven't seen in topics related to these concepts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to keep things simple in the geospatial world just like in other aspects of information technology.&nbsp; Many people, including IT professionals, do not have an understanding about geospatial information or the variety of GIS software and tend to go with overly complex solutions that potentially could solve all their problems.&nbsp; Rather, a bottom-up approach, as in many aspects of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data, would be just as appropriate here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a BIG difference between geospatial information and GIS. A huge challenge we all face is the abundance of information; data collection strategies and search and discovery methods are difficult to "get right" for everybody.&nbsp; Information is important! &nbsp; Tools can be built around it, and more tools will come later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's add geospatial coordinates to standard web pages and documents.&nbsp; Let's make sure we add location names to information.&nbsp; Names could be administrative, cultural, or physical.&nbsp; Web services and tools can handle this information in many ways (distances between web pages, RSS feeds on a map), but it must be present first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a lot that goes into the term GIS. People use it often in misleading ways.&nbsp; A Geographic Information System is usually a large system that handles many aspects, from storage to analysis to display of geospatial data.&nbsp; There is a BIG difference among the following, w.r.t. geospatial information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol><li>storage (file formats, databases)</li><li>context or project files (ways of keeping all project information together)<br /></li><li>analysis&nbsp; <br /></li><li>display</li><li>search and discovery (including exploratory data analysis)</li><li>communication protocols</li></ol>
<p>Let's build small, efficient, modular components that have their respective strengths in one of the above categories.&nbsp; Let these components be developed and enhanced individually, not technologically dependent on each other.&nbsp; Let communities build their own applications that can utilize Recovery.gov/ARRA information in ways unthought of now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maps (and charts) are great.&nbsp; Patterns will emerge and be found that would not be found otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let geospatial data formats for maps be open, readable by everyone.&nbsp; Let's have open context/project files that can be shared among everyone.&nbsp; Open data formats and contextual files are just as, if not more, important than the final maps themselves.&nbsp; (The explosion of maps through KML taught us that.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's make the communication among these components (from data to analysis to display) open and available to everybody.&nbsp; Let's use common, existing protocols to pass information back and forth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's tag our information and build our tools in growing and enthusiastic environments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's not put up barriers to what may be one of the most important collections of data in our country today.&nbsp; The term "National Dialogue" is a great idea and model to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
This idea is building simple, modular components; treating storage, display,
analysis of geodata separately; using open communication protocols between these components; and keeping geospatial information
separate from
<p> the tools that process it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Many other already proposed ideas do a good job at describing the benefits of maps and geospatial information. As of this writing (May 2, 15:30 EDT) five out of the top ten most commented ideas concern geospatial information (not counting the Linked Open Data idea proposed by Tim Berners-Lee, which could very well be argued applies here.)</p>
<p>It is obvious to many the importance of viewing maps on the web, as well as on TV broadcasts, newspapers, books, etc...&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an enlightening (and entertaining!) way to display information and pull out patterns not necessarily seen otherwise.</p>
<p>This specific idea falls in line with many other ideas proposed The Dialogue, from Linked Data to open document formats, to Google Earth tracking, to semantic web initiatives. &nbsp; Keeping things smaller, faster, and open allows for geospatial information and tools to become part of our everyday news and work-flow and applicable to many of the emerging ideas within Information Technologies.</p>

<p>Good discussion - puts a common sense spin on the mapping and geospatial ideas that have been popular throughout the open dialogue.&nbsp; I think highlighting making the communication among the various components of a mapping approach -- "data to analysis to display" -- open and available to everybody is important.&nbsp; Ensuring we collect the appropriate location data is obviously key (location namne, zip code, etc.).</p>

<p>I'm concerned by exactly the same things as you.&nbsp; None of us want wasteful or inappropriate spending.&nbsp; However, it's difficult to determine what is wasteful and what is not.&nbsp; Often, it's dependent upon the person or agency doing the evaluation. &nbsp; Looking at data through a map (same as a chart or graph) helps some people to determine that. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;
<p>One of the main aspects of this proposed idea is to add geospatial information to data and web pages being published out to citizens.&nbsp; That way, I can compare ARRA spending to what other government agencies are spending in the same areas, and what they're spending it on.&nbsp; I can compare what ARRA is spending to the population or average income, or demographics, or school performance, or housing market, or number of disasters, or unemployment rate to certain areas.&nbsp; My state and county govenment staff can more easily track fed spending for their areas.&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>Everyone can do this simply by looking at maps, or by doing more complex geographic analysis through their own agencies.&nbsp; It's another way to sift through all the infromation that's out there.&nbsp; And a great way to aggregate data (by location) from a large variety of news sources, government agencies, web sites publishing all types of information. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;
<p>The other major point of this idea is to keep the "GIS" or geospatial software to a minimum.&nbsp; It should not obstruct other information.&nbsp; It's to allow the IT groups to implement small pieces of software that are strong and specific to geospatial analysis, and can be enhanced and fixed without getting in the way.&nbsp; It's to allow everyone (open and transparent) access to all of the geo-enabled information to look at or analyze as they wish.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>President Obama has the vision, we have to match that vision on the implementation/organizational side of the equation, while we save money, leverage limited resources, and demonstrate practical and useful outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without a fundamental shift in how we implement programs, our President will be blamed if things "don't work". The public rarely thinks about the organizational capacity needed to match a truly different paradigm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My idea combines the fundamental principles of good government, efficiency, best practices and accountability with Web 2.0 social media technologies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Utilizing social networking practices, in grant and other applied setting programs, will enhance the ability of agencies to communicate, organize work products, share discoveries, conduct failure analysis and break down geographical boundaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a convergence between how social networks, properly administrated, would work, save money, deal with geographical issues, promote best practices and address many grant administration and program problems and issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many choices in how we set up a social networks.&nbsp; I am suggesting using the Ning framework.&nbsp; It is easy to create closed systems/networks, only for the grantees in each grant program and the grant administrator, not open to the general public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to use social networking platforms as program tools. Right now grant administration is labor intensive, very costly and rarely captures the wins in the communities granted the funds.&nbsp; We "get together" with our grantees by inviting them to come to Washington, DC for a conference, maybe once a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the time the grantees never really know each other or what they are doing with the funding, they rarely get to share a great idea or big problem, they are scattered around the country craving connection and usually not getting it in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grantees may get site visits, but that is only one part of the grant program and always a snapshot.&nbsp; Even training and technical assistance needs could be met in different ways with much less money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applied and practical evaluation methodologies could easily be facilitated through a well designed social network as well.&nbsp; On the ground, community programs would greatly benefit by learning how to conduct meaningful evaluation strategies, without having to become scientists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you imagine, if each grant initiative had their own&nbsp; social network, as part of their grant?&nbsp; Only the grantees would be allowed to be members.&nbsp; The grant administrator would also be the social network administrator. It would make so many things easier, including communication, geography, best practices shared between grantees, evaluation, etc.&nbsp; It would save a lot of money and time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My extensive experience in grants, grant evaluation, training, technical assistance, building collaborative partnerships, discovering best practices and planning for results, in combination with using this social networking framework, convinces me this technology would make a significant difference in the accomplishment of tricky and multiple goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure this will change the landscape of how we manage complex program initiatives. It doesn't solve all the problems, but it will help a lot and meet many criteria not met currently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Administration challenges federal agencies to think outside the box, increase accountability and public transparency, we will see a simultaneous emphasis on collaboration, community building, leveraging resources, reducing redundancy and increasing outcomes with public money.&nbsp; The social networking paradigm I'm suggesting will meet these goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Utilizing social networking practices, in grant and other applied setting programs, will enhance the ability of agencies to communicate, organize work products, share discoveries and break down geographical boundaries (huge issue). Security, delicate issues and finances do not need to be a part of this for this to work!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Background:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recipient of $3M Community Partnership Grant to Study Community Collaboration, Planning for Results and Applied Setting Evaluation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justice Department Fellow at COPS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retrospectively evaluated the innovative Advancing Community Policing Grants in the United States.&nbsp; Matched evaluation style with the values we wanted to create to cut down on cognitive dissonance.&nbsp; Justice and I published a best practices book (about this project) and distributed it to over 7,000 local law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have extensive experience is using social networks to build community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>We will match President Obama's vision with actual practice.&nbsp; We will save time and money and accomplish many things that were previously labor intensive.</p>
<p>We will connect people all over the country, under each grant program, into one community.&nbsp; We will infuse the social networks with the values and goals integral to the project goals.</p>
<p>We will build online communities, increase efficiency, capitalize on grantee learning, discover issues quickly, use the "community to solve problems", save money, time and leverage limited resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's innovative, creative, uses knowledge in practical ways, can be shared and replicated and continuously improved.</p>
<p>In addition it will increase our organizational capacity, grantee capacity and connect people far beyond the grant cycle so we are likely to have more sustainable results.</p>

<p>There are several Federal Agencies who do create "grantee" communities already.&nbsp; SAMHSA is the agency I know best who does this.&nbsp; But they do not use the latest social networking technology, just a combination of list-serves, monthly conference calls,&nbsp;semi-annual regional meetings, and annual meetings.&nbsp; The communication is directed to the grantees, not to state of local community partners.&nbsp; Webcasts, net-meetings, chat rooms, places to post and easily comment on documents, would definitely increase the efficiency of these efforts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an MBA student with prior experience in the nonprofit sector, I have enjoyed learning about ways that corporations are leveraging the power of social networks to better connect with their consumers, promote their brands, and ultimately help the bottom line. While some nonprofits and grantmakers are starting to utilize these technologies, it's time for Web 2.0 and social media platforms to be woven into the grantor/grantee relationship. Access to and sharing of information, best practices, and tangible outcomes are crucial to building powerful, long-term&nbsp;funding relationships--and social networks are a quick, easy, and effective way to do just that.</p>

<p>The submitter is correct, the way to leverage up the services of the granting agency is create a social networking site where grantees can exchange their successes and failures, become aware of good practices, and make real-time course adjustments to their programs.&nbsp; Everbody wins in this one.&nbsp; The governments program is sucessful, and the recipients deliver quality programming.&nbsp; Great idea, and inexpensive.</p>

<h1>
				Create a Master Data Management schema for use by govt. agencies
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>IBM has a solution called Master Data Management that would provide significant savings, improved performance, and better accuracy of data that agencies and departments in the Federal government need to service citizens as well as employees. <br />Master Data describes physical entities in the real world - such as people, organizations, products, assets and accounts. It is kept by organizations and used to control much of their operation.</p>
<p>Master data is the information an organization stores about the key elements (or business entities) that define its operation.&nbsp; Examples are:</p>
<h1></h1>
<ul><li>Information about people and organizations such as employees, suppliers, partners and departments</li><li>Information about "things" such as products, assets, services, materials, stock </li><li>information about contracts and agreements such as bank accounts, insurance policies, credit agreements, which explain who is using (or is entitled) to use what. </li></ul>
<p>Associated with these Master Data entities are relationships between business entities, hierarchical structures to show how they are organized and classified along with histories of interaction such as audit trails.</p>
<p>Master data is high value information that an organization uses repeatedly across many business processes and lines of businesses (LOBs). For these to operate efficiently, this master data must be accurate and consistent to ensure good decisions. Unfortunately in many organizations, master data is fragmented across many applications, with many inconsistent copies and no plan to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Customers attempting to adopt a Services oriented Architecture (SOA)&nbsp;are having problems supporting simple services such as <em>getCustomerDetails()</em> because their customer data is so scattered and inconsistent that it is not possible to locate and reconcile all of the copies of a customer record on the fly. The master data needs to be corrected at source. <em><strong>Distributing bad data to more people only makes matters worse</strong></em>.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>With the implementation of MDM, there would be significant savings in the number of databases being used and the processes of having to sync them up&nbsp;continuously.&nbsp; The accuracy of the data in these disparate databases would be much improved, and more real time decisions could be made with valid data.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether it is IBM or any other vendor, the MDM concept is vitally important here for the success fo recovery.gov.&nbsp; In essence, this is a data architecture construct that would let recovery.gov use existing data sources, dramatically reducing the burden on government, universities, and others who must&nbsp;submit reports.&nbsp; At the same time, MDM would&nbsp;reduce data errors due to semantic issues&nbsp;and&nbsp;other&nbsp;inconsistencies in&nbsp;systems used by&nbsp;those having to submit reports.&nbsp; However, deployment of MDM is not free, and consistent federal leadership would be required to deal with those&nbsp;would resist transparency&nbsp;by keeping data in customized formats.&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp;the federal government would have to figure out an effective deployment strategy, which would involve a snow-balling effect...perhaps by requiring modification to the standard&nbsp;federal receivables format&nbsp;(at least bill presentment), the performance/results report submitted with the bill (building on or simplifying the current earned value reqt),&nbsp;and&nbsp;accounts payable data string.&nbsp; This would save a lot of money all levels of govt are spending on administration and to comply with recovery.gov reporting reqts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				Provide Data in Common Formats
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Recovery.gov is operating on a fast timetable.&nbsp; Those working with its data want to operate with similar speed.&nbsp; To do so, the exposed data needs to be available in formats with low barriers to use -- that means good documentation, minimal cost and robust communities of users.&nbsp; In practice, that means free, open formats: XML, JSON, N3, YAML -- the specific choice doesn't matter nearly as much as the fact that it is non-proprietary and well-supported by noncommercial tools.<br /><br />Within these formats, existing standards should be used whenever possible.&nbsp; The site's architects should look to XBRL, KML, Atom/RSS, the USASpending.gov API result format and other relevant standards.&nbsp; The creation of new standards should be a last resort.<br /><br />Finally, it should be noted that the importance of openness extends not only to the means of organizing the records, but the records themselves.&nbsp; All released data must be public domain.&nbsp; In the past, some federal systems have used proprietary data like Dun &amp; Bradstreet's DUNS system for identifying entities.&nbsp; Even when such identifiers are offered to the government without cost, they can present significant legal roadblocks to downstream users of the resulting datasets.&nbsp; Such proprietary identifiers should be avoided whenever possible.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<div>Web based software to monitor the 
Stimulus Bill projects in various states, to ensure they are&nbsp;properly funded, 
managed and accounted for and are&nbsp;transparent to all&nbsp;interested parties. To 
assist in this endeavor, Level One Technologies&nbsp;has developed&nbsp;a web based 
application that&nbsp;will be modified to meet these requirements&nbsp;at the federal 
level and on a state by state basis.&nbsp;The application is an ASP, based on Epay 
Manager (<a>www.epaymanager.com</a>), a solution our company&nbsp;developed 
for the transportation industry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>To review the&nbsp;details of&nbsp;a proposal we've made 
to&nbsp;the state of Missouri, please use the&nbsp;following link:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a>http://issuu.com/levelonetechnologies/docs/transform20</a><a></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The new system will be available&nbsp;in 12 weeks and 
will&nbsp;allow&nbsp;the&nbsp;federal or any state government&nbsp;to 
enter and/or download Stimulus Bill projects and proposals,&nbsp;collect and store 
all related documents,&nbsp;track each proposal's&nbsp;progress through the review and 
approval process,&nbsp;using sequential approval chains and provide&nbsp;a mechanism for 
the state to collect and store post funding updates and documents required&nbsp;by 
the Federal government.&nbsp;The system&nbsp;will feature unique lists of transactions by 
status (pending, processing, approved, rejected, funded and completed); it&nbsp;has 
the ability to initiate funding using ACH transfers and offers a complete audit 
trail for each transaction. In addition,&nbsp;the system&nbsp;will offer&nbsp;a full&nbsp;range of 
search and reporting tools for both public and&nbsp;government use, with safeguards 
for&nbsp;documents that are not subject to sunshine&nbsp;law provisions. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The software is&nbsp;available&nbsp;for an annual licensing 
fee, plus the cost of any customizations that your agency may require.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please contact me at your earliest convenience to 
discuss whether&nbsp;this application&nbsp;can assist you in meeting&nbsp;your agency's 
Stimulus Bill reporting responsibilities.</div>

<p>This program is excellent! It handles all contingencies and makes sure all parties know exactly what happens in each instance. There is no excuse not to utilize this platform to manage any and all State or Federal projects. It is just what the American people need. We need to know where the money comes from and where it goes and did we get what we paid for? If not, why not? We will have a solid basis to make corrections to procedures to insure a profitable outcome.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The current charts/graphs featured on the recovery.gov home page are awful. I know you guys have spoken with Edward Tufte some (pro bono on his part), but I'd like you to engage someone more like Stephen Few (I have NO affiliation with Stephen Few or Perceptual Edge, other than being a fan of his work). 95% of the information people want can best be represented with some flavor of a line chart (including sparklines) or a bar chart (including bullet graphs). And, it can be done while minimizing the data-pixel ratio. There is GOOD information out there on best practices, and that will go a <em>long</em> way to not only "providing the data" but "providing information."</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Most of the people who will visit recovery.gov will underestimate the complexity of the underlying data. That's just the way data works. At the same time, most of the people who are collecting/aggregating the data are analytically-oriented, and most of the people who are doing web design are design-oriented. To effectively provide meaningful data-based information, these two disciplines have to be married together. There are a handful of basic principles required to do this effectively, and the current site is not demonstrating an understanding of those principles -- either on the home page or in the various .csv files that are available further down in the site. Without effectively <em>presenting</em> the information to the public, this entire exercise is for nought.</p>

				GIS based web portal
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Considering the geographic spread of recovery investment, suggests following design elements.</p>
<p>[11 Create a Web&nbsp;GIS&nbsp;may provide best&nbsp;visualization tool.</p>
<p>[2] Provide three separate and simultaneous views – (1) National, (2)State, (3)City/Rural, to display summary of investment projects. Users may use zip code to search information, translated to the 3 levels of data display.</p>
<p>[3] Data based charting/dashboard server applets to display statistics, along the 3 views [item2]. Use multi-dimension data warehouse methods to summarize statistics.</p>
<p>[4] Provide blog-entry feature along the 3 views [tem2], for citizen to engage in conversation</p>
<p>[5] Provide simplified project-charts [progress] on each project site</p>
<p>[6] provide demographic data [working population] around project site, to show the improvements due to the recovery project.</p>
<p>[7] Provide a Post-Project Review and feedback feature to learn from the project implementation process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The geographic spread of projects and volume of communities need unique ways to display information, capture feedback and evaluate project processes and success.&nbsp;Such a context needs a GIS centric, data driven views, after action review features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I agree that a spatially-enabled view of recovery expenditures and investments would be a highly provocative visual display.&nbsp; I believe there is also a temporal (time) component to the recovery investment story. So, I would recommend including timeperiods (slices) so that sequenced investment could be depicted as a change in a chart or map over time. The results at any scale from item 2i)-iii)&nbsp;would make for good video clips as media collateral.</p>

				Leverage commercial vitrualization solutions
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Recovery.gov should be a poster
child of the modern IT solution.&nbsp; This would include 100% virtualized
computing resources that are out sourced to an industry leader in providing
commercial companies “cloud” services.&nbsp; This will allow a cost competitive
solution based solely on the solution and not on the acquisition, initial,
support, and other elements inherent in a asset ownership model – this amounts
to up to a 50% reduction in operating costs including the initial
startup.&nbsp; The cloud has the added benefit in increasing the platform
availability, and allow flexible and right sizing of the solution without
the Government buying or decommission hardware assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Cloud solution has the added
benefit in being GREEN – as there is an estimated 60% reduction in hardware
costs and power usage.&nbsp; The net effect of this is a reduction in the
carbon footprint and power consumed in a datacenter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>If recovery.gov follows the path of using commerical practices and outsourcing, this will highlight the viability of a similar effort by other agencies.&nbsp; This one effort would set the stage of reducing the cost of IT and increase the flexibility.</p>

<p>While I like the idea, the implementation by the various government and commercial organizations would be governed by their internal IT architecture standards.&nbsp; These architecture standards may not yet include server and workstation virtualization.&nbsp; The existing physical technology may not yet support virtualization.&nbsp;</p>

				eGovernment Internal Web-Services Utilization
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to maximize efficiencies through the utilization of recovery expenditures (or&nbsp;eGovernment&nbsp;efficiencies in general,)&nbsp;the internal technology leveraged by the government for managing the expenditures and the technology leveraged for transparent public-facing reporting of&nbsp;expenditures should utilize the same web-services&nbsp;structures and implementations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, don't build two systems; instead configure a single implementation to meet numerous simultaneous needs.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dramatically-increasing role of government in managing the recovery expenditures comes with great risk for misperceptions and decreased trust. By leveraging a common-services approach, this risk can be mitigated through the transparency of &nbsp;"one-stop-shop" web-services where government manages programmatic expenditures and the public receives recovery progress reporting and expenditure updates.</p>

<h1>
				10 Core Principles of Recovery.Gov Collaboration
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How can 
Recovery.Gov help mobilize all our skills and creativity to make the recovery 
faster, stronger, and more accountable?</strong></p>
<p>The following tries to summarize ten basic principles for true collaboration among 
government, citizens, business, and all other stakeholders.&nbsp; All of these principles relate to or are supported by other contributions over the week, and come from a global team working on the question.</p>
<ol><li><strong>Keep the user experience super simple</strong> (give power 
users extra tabs for advanced tools)</li><li><strong>Enable deep and broad coverage</strong> (deep means allowing 
drill down on every contracted dollar spent along with where it went by person 
and stock keeping unit as though Wal-Mart were managing the spend; broad means 
covering all related spending over time by location as well as all related 
people and their relationships. For example, citizens can then add analytics on 
the political contributions of the vendors getting the contracts. This kind of 
analysis will be done anyway, so Recovery.Gov should accelerate the 
process.) 
</li><li><strong>Compare all data geographically</strong> (down to each local 
address by latitude and longitude...up to each of the states...and across 
borders to related international stimulus efforts) 
</li><li><strong>Keep data as current as possible</strong> (time stamped and 
including an expected time, if available, of the next update) 
</li><li><strong>Let the community rate it all</strong> (data feeds, projects 
and grants, content and comment contributions to the site, as well as the 
authority/credibility of the contributors) 
</li><li><strong>Enlist all available tools and users</strong> ((mashups of 
maps, micro blogs, video, pictures, advanced analytics, you name it; and support 
multiple languages, WYSIWYG editing, and accessibility) 
</li><li><strong>Integrate social networking</strong> (proactively integrate 
with Facebook, Linked-in, et al) 
</li><li><strong>Meet every day needs</strong> (enable interfaces to relevant 
transactions for calendar updating, bar coding, etc.) 
</li><li><strong>Expand on Wikipedia's role model</strong> (Maintain a 
secured, official government site and a related public commentary/add-on site; 
let logged-in contributors link every expression or element to its definition 
and related information; maintain a public revision history so logged-in 
contributors can make additions and corrections that can always be reverted; 
flag any conflicts of interest, offering voluntary protocols that let 
contributors proactively disclose potential conflicts in their user profile; go 
beyond Wikipedia to redact malicious content so vandalism can be reviewed 
publicly, but can't be misread as legitimate content) 
</li><li><strong>Redact vandalism</strong> (immediately delete any vandalism 
on the public commentary/add-on site in a public format so it can be reviewed by 
the public but can't be misread as legitimate content)</li></ol>

				First, find out what folks want to know by interest group.

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>There are different constituencies that will want to have access to this information--John Q. Public wants to know what his tax dollars are being spent on; Jane Contractor wants to know what agencies are acquiring and to know about business opportunities; Edward Academia will want to know both of the above for analysis of process, governance, etc.</p>
<p>With that, we can be assured of gathering the right information that folks want to know versus just lots of information.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The gathering of data and recording it in various systems is a time-consuming task on an already-burdened staff.&nbsp; By ensuring we gather the information that is wanted, we can reduce the collection of data that no one is interested in.&nbsp; This will help to ensure data quality and timeliness and will help to reduce "inquiries" because we only put part of the information folks wanted to see on the website.&nbsp; This will avoid additional workload to respond to ad hoc inquiries.</p>

Prof. Tufte's books are must-reads for anyone designing the graphical presentation of data. According to the wikipedia entry, the NY Times called him "the da Vinci of Data."</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Data presentation can be informative, interesting, dry, misleading, or confusing. Well-presented, data can be extremely informative and compelling. The how is as important as the what. Tufte's expertise is world-class and the American people deserve the best!</p>

				Recovery.gov needs extensive reporting on job creation AND job quality
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The key goal of the Recovery Act is job creation, but the Act also seeks to build the foundation for future economic growth. This means that stimulus spending should foster the creation of high-quality rather than low-wage, substandard positions.</p>
<p>To be able to judge both the overall success of the Act in reaching this goal and the performance of each entity receiving stimulus funding, Recovery.gov has to provide good employer-specific information on the number AND quality of the jobs being created. As the Coalition for an Accountable Recovery has <a class="external-link" href="http://www.ombwatch.org/files/budget/CAR_Comments_on_OMB_Memo_M-09-15.pdf">recommended</a>, this means requiring each Recovery Act contractor or subcontractor (at both the federal and the state level) to report on the hours of work performed by workers as well as the total payroll. Info on health insurance coverage should also be included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Every company receiving Recovery Act contracts should be held to a high level of accountability, to make sure the money is being spent in a way that promotes the goals of the Act. By using total hours and total payroll dollars, the privacy of individual employees can be protected.</p>

<h1>
				Achieving transparency requires STRATEGY before technology
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">At a recent northern Virginia technology event, Federal CIO Vivek Kundra declared that the "days of multi-billion government IT systems are over." He went on to make the case for technologies that increase time-to-value yet decrease total cost-of-ownership. However, the more urgent (and more complex) challenge was Mr. Kundra's opening declaration: "IT investments must be tied to performance and outcomes."</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, while this online dialogue focuses on a discussion of technologies, it is equally critical to discuss the STRATEGY for leveraging, aligning, and vetting such technologies. Specifically, the Administration must engage its agencies to think about this challenge in terms of "Mission Performance Management."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mission Performance Management (MPM) principles provide a foundation for mission and operational transparency in federal agencies and set the stage for a clear mapping of agency strategy to program operations, alignment of business architecture to enable line-of-sight visibility, standardization of data collection, and coordination among organizational stakeholders.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The MPM approach, developed by CSC's Strategy Services, provides a holistic view of establishing and sustaining high performance, transparency, and accountability: First, it aligns mission goals and strategy with business architecture and process improvement. Second, it integrates the right data with the best tool to create line-of-sight visibility into operations. And third, it integrates both organizational design and human capital training as vital components that sustain operational performance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the MPM approach starts with strategy and business alignment in order to better baseline performance and establish vision. Specifically, this approach enables and integrated understanding of how an agency’s infrastructure, performance data, business processes, and governance work together and where they need improvement. Many agencies have immature data collection and maintenance processes and therefore require a strategy to systematically identify systems of record and necessary improvements to internal data management.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Only when a strategy dialogue precedes the technology discussion will changes lead to the desired outcomes -- and ultimately, to the goals of greater transparency and accountability.</p>

<h1>
				Complete Accountability and Transparency For Every Process
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> At the core of accountability and transparency is visibility into the status, information, and processes of each program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most processes in place today are manual—this not only means poor visibility but manual reporting which leaves room for error. Plus, means of automating theses processes are too expensive and take too long to implement to satisfy the timeframe of Recovery Act guidelines.&nbsp; This is not an option when speed is an important factor.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Lean Business Process Management (BPM) offers a swift and pragmatic approach to process management. Lean BPM solutions make is simple to design and deploy collaborative applications quickly—these applications automate processes, capture critical data at every step, and provide full transparency across a process.<br /><img class="image-inline image-inline" src="copy_of_FullAuditHistory.png/image_preview" alt="Full Audit History and Comprehensive Reports" /></p>
<p>Additionally, Lean BPM solutions are built for non-coders, people like Business Analysts, so they can quickly make changes to their collaborative applications (without involving technical resources) as guidelines continue to evolve. <br /><img class="image-inline image-inline" src="copy2_of_copy_of_VisualDesigner.png/image_preview" alt="Visual Designer for Rapid Implementation" />&nbsp;<br /><strong>See An Example:</strong> Here’s an example of a Lean BPM application powered by Serena Business Mashups. It’s an application that manages the process for ARRA Project Submission, Review, and Approval. In true lean fashion, it was built in just hours, and deployed in minutes. You can check it out on Serena’s site at <a class="external-link" href="http://www.serena.com/go/arra">www.serena.com/go/arra</a>.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Manual processes make full traceability and accountability a nearly impossible goal. What’s more is that traditional systems for automating processes are expensive, cumbersome, and require costly technical resources.</p>
<p>Lean BPM solutions offer an alternative. With Lean BPM you design and deploy your own collaborative applications without coding skills. These applications bring speed to your organization with streamlined processes and have detailed audit logs built right in.</p>
<p><strong>Agency Example:</strong> U.S. Office of Personnel Management<br />Over the last five years, OPM has been leveraging a Lean BPM solution powered by Serena Business Mashups. The collaborative applications OPM deployed manage the communication, collaboration and enforcement of its standard processes, such as legal reviews, purchase requests and employee on-boarding. In that timeframe, their Lean BPM solution has been instrumental in developing roughly 80 process solutions in the areas of health benefits, background checks, FOIA requests, OMB Circular A123 compliance, processes for federal acquisitions and IT defect and enhancement management.</p>
<p>Currently 60% of OPM employees use these collaborative applications and that is expected to grow to 100% in the next two years.</p>
<p>Many of the <strong>processes that typically took over a year to deploy in prior systems are now being deployed in less than two months</strong>. Before using their Lean BPM solution, managing processes was highly labor intensive and inefficient, and managers had very little visibility into whether projects were proceeding in a timely manner, or if resources were allocated strategically.</p>
<p>Now, with Serena’s Lean BPM solution, managers know where projects and processes stand and quickly identify and clear bottlenecks. Because workflow is automated and tracked, employees and teams are fully accountable for the work they perform and cannot bypass standard procedures.</p>
<p>Thanks to reminders, escalations and other notifications, employees know exactly what’s expected of them and when they’ve received ownership.</p>
<p>Automated processes built with Serena's Lean BPM tool are also helping OPM better manage Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act requests. The agency processes 20,000 of these requests per year and must report on the results to the Department of Justice and on its own Web site.&nbsp; Using Serena to develop a process to do that was far less expensive for OPM than an available commercial off-the-shelf product.</p>
<p>There are a host of agencies and departments streamlining processes with Serena’s Lean BPM solution. If you'd like to learn more, feel free to <a class="external-link" href="mailto:cbonamassa@serena.com">contact me</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong> This submission was provided by Serena Software, Inc. Serena Software was recently selected to participate in the "Six Strategies to Survive the Stimulus" event on April 29th at the National Press Club in Washington, DC. Additionally, Serena participated in the panel discussions along with GAO, OPM, and DOT.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;I agree with BPM (this idea was previously raised by RSchrader), i would prefer to see lean six sigma rather than just lean.&nbsp; Too often in government, i have seen lean efforts get rid of necessary controls and reporting because the process owners didn't see the value in making their program transparent or accountable -- it was seen as non-valuable paperwork burden.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Why not give these branches credit cards instead of checks?&nbsp; Most people know how a debit card works, and the purchases are easily traced.&nbsp; The government already has several different cards ranging from EBT to child support and beyond.&nbsp; Isn't it possible to request how many cards will each department need and then track the statements?</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>In my opinion, it is easier to falsify purchases if you write a check than if you use a card.&nbsp; Using a stimulus debit card would allow greater tracking of the funds.&nbsp; The cards would have to be configured differently than debit cards, but the idea remains basically the same.</p>

<h1>
				Social Media Tools for Local Government Reporting
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I am suggesting that guidance could be given to local government, perhaps even templates, for the use of social media to report recovery project information. I set up a quick example of how this could be accomplished for a fake project in a fake city using a fake contractor. You can find this example at <a class="external-link" href="http://recoveryprojectexample.blogspot.com/">Recovery Project Example.</a> (All info on this site has been set up only for the purpose of the demo although the Flickr photos are actual construction photos from my own stream, but used only to help illustrate the idea here.)</p>
<p>Most projects have similar events or steps that could easily be archived and reported in this manner. The idea is that all of this information is being generated anyway behind the scenes. Using social media just helps to get it in the hands of the public in an easy to access and potentially engaging format.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Social media tools offer the opportunity for distribution of real time
information, plus give the public the opportunity to provide feedback. This is important so that the public is kept up to date on project-related issues and information as soon as possible. Also, social media allows for dissemination of knowledge in an easy to understand format.</p>
<p>Also, the cost to implement this is minimal because the tools are open source or free, and the project team is already generating this information.</p>

<p>Guidance to states about the use of&nbsp;social media for reporting would be helpful.&nbsp; In Washington we are pretty savvy about that stuff, but it is still pretty new and we have a long way to go.&nbsp; The concern for state governments, I think, will be how to keep the public and the Federal government informed on the status of spending and projects.&nbsp; If there was a way that these tools could meet both needs, that would be welcome by the states.</p>

				Make it easy to translate data to sharable location based intelligence.

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The biggest barrier to communicating information geospatially is the difficulty and cost of translating data into a communicative geospatial form. The usual result is a static or difficult to use or share interactive map. We have just released a free beta version of a product that dramatically reduces those barriers. Please try it - spatialkey.com - and give us your feedback. We think it can make a significant contribution to the work of this community.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Unlocking information and presenting it in a highly interactive and and collaborative geospatial form will accelerate understanding and foster faster more informed stakeholder decision making on today's most critical social, economic and policy based issues.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Technology like Informatica’s PowerCenter enable organizations to rapidly access structured or unstructured data in a codeless environment and to cleanse, transform and deliver that data in any format and latency required.&nbsp; The source to target relationship can be one to many or many to one.&nbsp; At the heart of PowerCenter is a metadata repository which enables organizations to access full data lineage including where the data is, what the data is and when it was last changed.</p>
<p>Informatica PowerCenter is designed for the enterprise and can scale to process massive amounts of data.&nbsp; For example PowerCenter is supporting &nbsp;customers processing up to 300 million transactions a day&nbsp;while accessing data from hundreds of data sources.</p>
<p>Informatica’s technology provides the ability to rapidly onboard and mange thousands of organizations or partners where data is exchange.</p>
<p>Bottom line, the technology exist today to provide the "Data Plumbing"&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;provide you quality data when you need it, where you need it and in the format you need it&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are organizations already using cost controls systems like e-Builder to manage, control, and track expenditures, both from the ARRA and beyond.

<div>New semantic technology could establish applications and portals which help poeple to interact with governmental authorities more easy.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>People could be supported to find the right service for their request or a precise anwer for their question.

<div>The citizen should start a process that keeps the user informed about the status and offers the oppotunity for querstions to a personal agent.

This personalized accounts can be used to identify the needed services and information for him without any search by the user.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My company offers a middleware for the integration challanges and <strong>semantic interpretation of all the data to provide the right information in a given context,</strong> like a question, a requested service of a running process and even the peoples profile. The architecture is flexible to consider different data silos, security and privacy requirements and the management of terrabytes of data. The analytic approach is an automatic procedure to avoid huge investments in semantic data modelling.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span">There is also a benefit for the Governmental organizations, which become a central access to all the different data silos. It's a kind of virtual data warehouse, high scalable and with real time information.&nbsp;</span></div>

<p>Poeple often don't know where they find the information or the right service and agent for their needs. And often they must invest time in going to a governmental office and handle a lot of paper and forms. This could be more easy.</p>
<p>The technical approach ovoids investments in migrating data, modelling ontologies or any orher preperation. It is a full automatic analysis for a dynamic organization of all information and services.</p>

<p>I also agree. Semantic technologies can be difficult to implement and maintain (especially if you need to manage the taxonomy) but you can accomplish the same thing with the underlying technologies behind simple tag clouds. E.g. purely quantity of similar words in listings.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Any undertaking of the scope of recovery.gov will inevitably face data quality issues.&nbsp; It will be important to harness the public's curiousity to identify and correct these problems.&nbsp; Depending on the nature of the expected problems, this may be as simple as an AJAX button that visitors can click to indicate that a line item seems suspicious, or as involved as a ticket-filing workflow. In either case, the process will only be meaningful if personnel are made available to investigate and resolve the ensuing reports.&nbsp; A blog in which identified problems and their resolutions are discussed could provide transparency and a simple means for developers to stay abreast of dataset revisions that may affect their work.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>While the team implementing recovery.gov will no doubt do everything they can to ensure the correctness of the data they publish, there is no substitute for in-depth examination by members of the public -- whether local reporters, businessmen or concerned citizens -- who have the expertise and motivation to investigate specific subsets of the data.&nbsp; Harnessing their knowledge and energy can make recovery.gov more accurate and therefore more valuable.</p>

<p>Taking this idea a step further with&nbsp;a national database would be most advantageous. But I believe that this should also&nbsp;include a link to each&nbsp;state's website. This&nbsp;would allow full access of both a national listing and a state and local listing.&nbsp;I understand that&nbsp;confidence in the credit&nbsp;market will in turn&nbsp;produce a boost in the economy however the bureaucratic red tape also must not hinder the job creation process. What good is a stimulus if it doesn't help the very people it is supposed to? The process of job creation&nbsp;must be speeded up. A jobseeker should not have to unravel a maze of information about stimulus aided companies in order to find out if any jobs even existent. There should be a database comprised of available jobs in an easily accessable format. After all aren't we the ones funding this stimulus? Accountability and transparency of these jobs must be demanded by the jobseeker. This database should be user friendly and instituted soon.</p>

				Web Enabled Energy Consumption Geographic Dashboard

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>Create a publicly accessible website that will allow end users to directly monitor and view energy consumption for homes and businesses. This could be viewed&nbsp;at an aggregate&nbsp;level by geographic region, by industry, sector, private homes&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; Alerts could be set for specific locations when thresholds are reached, either indicating excessive consumption or optimally efficient energy utilization.&nbsp; This could be displayed&nbsp;visually on web enabled maps with color coded pins that could be selected and drilled into.&nbsp; In addition, credits or incentives could be granted for consumers or producers that operate at maximum efficiency, or conversely&nbsp;identified for excessive consumption. This could be shown in comparison to the amount of stimulus received. </strong></p>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>This idea would allow consumers and businesses to monitor their energy consumption and allow them to optimize usage along with getting credits in doing so.&nbsp;For businesses, stimulus funds could be compared to energy utilization.&nbsp;This information would be publicly available, so the news impact would be real-time.&nbsp; Researchers could access this information and monitor energy consumption as it occurs. Contests and rewards could be offered for optimally&nbsp;efficient behavior.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>
				Adapt successful federal data exchange programs to ARRA recipient reporting
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>A key factor to&nbsp;enabling the public to monitor&nbsp;Recovery Act&nbsp;spending&nbsp;is to get accurate and timely&nbsp;reports from contract, grant and loan recipients in a format that is highly reusable on the web. This is a massive challenge, with&nbsp;tens of thousands of&nbsp;state and local government entities alone among the universe of potential recipients required to report to the federal government.</p>
<p>The good news is that the federal government has tackled similar reporting and compliance situations before -- in partnership with state and local governments -- and can adapt successful models to enable efficient and effective&nbsp;recipient reporting.</p>
<p>The federal government could&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://gcn.com/articles/2009/03/09/commentary-message-flows-are-paramount.aspx">build upon the successes of existing federal information exchange programs</a>,&nbsp; such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s Central Data Exchange (CDX). The idea is to adapt free open source data exchange tools that the government already uses for&nbsp;other mission purposes&nbsp;to aggregate and publish the required Recovery Act recipient data. <a class="external-link" href="http://xml.coverpages.org/epa-cdx.html">EPA's CDX </a>applies this approach with the help of open source gateway technology that helps states report data required by environmental regulations. This approach can be adjusted at relatively low cost to convey the data called for by the Recovery Act.</p>
<p>An April 15, 2009&nbsp;executive forum co-hosted by the CGI Initiative for Collaborative Government and George Mason University dove deeper on this topic. Featured speakers included:</p>
<ul><li>Kshemendra Paul, Federal Chief Architect at OMB’s Office of E-Government and IT, who is actively involved in establishing a central governmentwide system for Recovery Act reporting. </li><li>David McClure, Managing Vice President at Gartner Government Research, who has consulted with numerous federal, state, and local government executives about the Recovery Act. </li><li>Stan Czerwinski, Director of Strategic Issues at the General Accountability Office, who coordinates GAO’s work on stimulus programs. </li><li>Lisa Schlosser, Director of the Office of Information Collection at the&nbsp; Environmental Protection Agency, who heads up EPA’s collection of environmental data submissions from state and local governments. </li></ul>
<p>For top-of-mind takeaways from the April 15 session and other related postings, see the following links:</p>
<p><a class="external-link" href="http://collaborativegov.org/MyBlog/tackling-transparency.html">Tackling Recovery Act Transparency </a></p>
<p><a class="external-link" href="http://federalnewsradio.com/?nid=150&amp;sid=1651108">Coverage from the DorobekInsider.com</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.collaborativegov.org">www.collaborativegov.org</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;fact that this approach&nbsp;is <a class="external-link" href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">open source </a>means it’s available to federal agencies, states and local governments to reuse to report and aggregate data from both very old and more modern systems.</p>
<p>This model could enable efficient quarterly recipient reporting of accurate project results for reuse and display on Recovery.gov. It also could offer at least three bonus benefits:</p>
<p>-First, it provides the ability to capture valuable data in a format that can be reused many ways for better decision-making –- both by citizens and government.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Second, it has high potential for reuse by states to help manage&nbsp;the challenge of sub-recipient reporting (for example, see <a href="http://www.cgi.com/recovery">www.cgi.com/recovery</a>).</p>
<p>–Third, it offers flexibility to change over time (as the meaning of “transparency” evolves).</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>It has been proven time and again&nbsp;that data processing without a robust network will only lead to fragments and chaos.&nbsp; As the most powerful nation in the world, we need THE NETWORK&nbsp;to make information available and on demand to&nbsp;consumers who need it.&nbsp; This will open up all kinds of&nbsp;doors to accomplish what we really need to&nbsp;accomplish.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did someone say healthcare reform?&nbsp; Without a robust network, we will be forced to scatter the data and make it nearly impossible to do simple task such as to validate&nbsp;who is who.&nbsp; We have been&nbsp;spinning way too many cycles to compensate, data processing wise, the disadvantage of not having a robust network.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because the information is compiled on a website, and the most frequented sites today are the networking sites.&nbsp; Not only will it give easier access to the information, but it will reach the younger generations that have grown less interested- helping them become interested younger and more informed adult citizens.

<p>While it is nice to flow information to the end-user by way of any and all of the social networks (Twitter, Facebook, MySpace) there needs to be accountability for what is provided. The old adage, I read it on the internet so it has to be true, doesn't pass muster any longer. There needs to be an independent organization that is responsible.</p>

				Proposed Application Programming Interfaces (API) for Recovery.gov
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>In response to Mr. Earl Devaney's request sent out via email this morning, I have prepared a short proposal for a set of APIs that can be operated by Recovery.gov to make all Recovery Act data available to the public.&nbsp; The APIs I'm about to describe leverage the metamodel described in my previous article at this URL:<br /><br /><a class="external-link" href="proposed-metamodel-for-recovery-act-accountability-transparency-reporting">http://www.thenationaldialogue.org/ideas/proposed-metamodel-for-recovery-act-accountability-transparency-reporting</a><br /><br />Here are the specific operations I'm proposing for the Recovery.gov data access API. There are probably other useful interfaces that could be added, but these are the major ones that should meet the needs of most use cases:<br /><br />Publishing APIs<br /><br /></p>
<ul><li>Add a new major communications report</li><li>Add a new stimulus program</li><li>Add a new stimulus program milestone</li><li>Add a new recipient</li><li>Add a new funding notification report</li></ul>
<p><br />Subscription APIs<br /><br /></p>
<ul><li>Retrieve Major Communications (by agency, communication type, date of communication, or tag):&nbsp; Output available as either Atom, RSS, or JSON</li><li>Retrieve Funding Allocation Reports (by agency, program, recipient, funding range, state, zip code range, date range, or jobs created):&nbsp; Output available as either Atom, RSS, JSON, or KML</li><li>Retrieve alerts and notifications (by agency, program, recipient, state, zip code range, or date range):&nbsp; Output available as either Atom, RSS, JSON, or KML. See <a class="external-link" href="using-alerts-and-notifications-to-provide-timely-problem-detection">http://www.thenationaldialogue.org/ideas/using-alerts-and-notifications-to-provide-timely-problem-detection</a> for more information</li></ul>
<p><br />As a general statement, these APIs should be implemented as web service interfaces.&nbsp; Specifically, I propose implementing them as RESTful services using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) GET or POST operations.&nbsp; "REST" is an acronym that means "Representational state transfer", and is a simpler alternative to other web service standards such as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most cases, input parameters are submitted to the service either via the HTTP URL query string (in the case of GET requests), or in the HTTP message body (in the case of POST requests).&nbsp; For the most part, output is in the form of the appropriate XML vocabulary (e.g., Atom, RSS, etc.), but in some cases non-XML output could be used (e.g., CSV or JSON) to support various use cases. For transactional (publishing) APIs, the appropriate authorization and encryption would be used (e.g., SSL).<br /><br />At Unisys, we are creating service interface specifications for the aforementioned API operations using the Web Service Description Language (WSDL) standard.&nbsp; These interfaces are being built into our Recovery Act Reporting Environment (RARE) product.&nbsp; I'd be delighted to have further discussions with the Recovery Act Accountability and Transparency Board about the applicability of these interfaces to Recovery.gov. <br /><br /></p>

<h1>
				Recovery.gov - Data Confusion or Data in Context?
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>As the central clearinghouse for all recovery related data, Recovery.gov has been tapped with managing and storing large amounts of data reported back by state and local governments on their recovery initiatives.&nbsp; It is not just storage of data that Recovery.gov is tasked with but also making this data available to interested individuals.&nbsp; Foremost amongst the interested parties, is the public, our citizens. How can they can get relevant, content rich information out of Recovery.gov.? To illustrate this, let’s imagine how a citizen might interact with Recovery.gov.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joe Q. Public lives in an area with high unemployment and a challenging housing market.&nbsp; It’s been a few months since ARRA was passed and he doesn't see a lot activity but there has been some press on the subject lately.&nbsp; It seems that the unemployment rate is falling and housing sales are up in the region.&nbsp; One of Joe's elected representatives went so far as to say "We've gotten an above average share of ARRA funds and things are getting better at an above average rate."&nbsp; Joe seems to remember the same exuberance in the past, so he decides to head to Recovery.gov and see what he can discover for himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once at Recovery.gov, Joe discovers that there is lots of data about his area and he can down load all of it.&nbsp; Wow, that's openness and transparency; he can't wait to get started.&nbsp; First hurdle, he's working at the library and they've restricted people's ability to down load data to the computer, you have to have a memory stick.&nbsp; The librarian explains that those are the policies but, in the interest of our story, lends him a memory stick.&nbsp;&nbsp; He busily starts to download the unemployment data, the housing data and the ARRA funding data to the borrowed stick.&nbsp; Once Joe opens the files he sees that they are all long lists of numbers that are separated by commas.&nbsp; What to do?&nbsp; Our friendly librarian helps Joe to copy the data to a spreadsheet and now he can see some of the measures associated with his region.&nbsp; The problem is that the data doesn't match up, some data is at the state level, some at the county level, FIPS County code, census track code.&nbsp; The data is also for different periods of time: quarterly, monthly, weekly.&nbsp; There's the data - open, transparent and useless. How to put all of this together?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an alternative, think about Recovery.gov as an information portal built upon and supported with Business Intelligence.&nbsp; IBM Cognos can provide a Business Intelligence platform that is open, standards-based and flexible.&nbsp; Recovery.gov built on Business Intelligence can make Joe Q. Public's experience very different.&nbsp; Joe logs onto Recovery.gov and finds his state.&nbsp; From his state, Joe enters his county, housing starts and unemployment into a search box.&nbsp; IBM Cognos, and its integration with search, returns a list of results that include some charts and maps of Joe's county, Joe chooses a map view of his area that shows housing starts.&nbsp; Given the increased # of homes on the market, it actually looks like sales % has been flat – it is not getting better, but it has leveled off.&nbsp; Joe copies the link of his analysis and posts it to the blog of his local TV station.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, Joe chooses to swap the map for a table of data and he adds unemployment rates to the table. He makes an interesting discovery: it looks like a spike in unemployment is a leading indicator for problems in housing.&nbsp; Looking at the recent data, there seems to be a downward movement in unemployment but 3 months is not a trend.&nbsp; Joe emails himself a copy of his analysis so that he can come back to it in the future and see if the numbers have changed.&nbsp; Joe's pleased that Recovery.gov had given him the tools that he needed to take the raw data and turn it into the information that he wanted.&nbsp; Not a bad day at the library...</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Guided exploration with context.&nbsp; This is what our citizens need.&nbsp; IBM Cognos can provide just such a platform.&nbsp; Since the information is modeled and presented to users with a drag and drop interface, citizens need not know how Counties and Census tracts relate to each other.&nbsp; Remove the complexity and manage it so that the user has the easiest experience possible.&nbsp; IBM Cognos provides citizen-centric reporting by providing guided exploration that pertains to all dimensions of information, regardless of where the data is stored. Users can perform complex analysis quickly and easily to get to the “why” behind the recovery data. Analyze data that's automatically organized in logical categories such as congressional district, investment category, progress of projects etc. Users can easily slice and dice the data and drill into details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have many existing citizen centric websites including the following:</p>
<p>Colorado School Accountability Reports: http://reportcard.cde.state.co.us/reportcard/CommandHandler.jsp</p>
<p>OPM: http://www.fedscope.opm.gov/;</p>
<p>City of Albequrque: http://cogpub.cabq.gov/cognos8/cgi-bin/cognos.cgi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is it important?&nbsp; Recovery.gov can provide knowledge and information built upon the data that can be viewed, analyzed and shared via the web or it can house raw data. Raw data that will increase the likelihood that multiple versions of the truth will be sold and reported on and that Joe Q. Public will still be at the library with open, transparent and useless data files.</p>

<p>I agree with this commentary and believe that there is clearly an urgency driving the need to locate solutions that have been developed to address the reporting requirements.&nbsp; The solution needs to be scalable in order to accomodate the many variations required at all levels.&nbsp; In some cases, a basic foundation solution will be adequate.&nbsp; Some cases will require a little more function and/or capacity.&nbsp; Still others may need a lot of functionality in order to deliver the results necessary and will also require larger repositories for all of the data being collected.&nbsp; This solution can clearly cover the range of requirements outlined by Recover Act guidance.</p>

<p>I appreciate that Recovery.gov has an opportunity to present data clearly and meaningfully to the public but the first step has to make the raw data available. That in and of itself is not an easy task so it deserves the main focus of the IT group. Once the data is out, we'll see an explosion of mashups that makes the AJAX-craze of '06 look like child's play.</p>

<h1>
				Low-Cost Web-Based Subscription Application to Track Stimulus Projects
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>ActiveStrategy StimulusScorecard - available on the GSA schedule for the federal government - is a low-cost, turn-key web-based service designed to allow recipients and subrecipients of funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA or Recovery Act) to effectively and proactively monitor and manage their projects and programs.</p>
<p>ActiveStrategy StimulusScorecard collects the project information required by the ARRA and makes real-time data available so governments can identify the preemptive action needed to prevent delays, waste, fraud, and abuse that could undermine program performance and public confidence. Simply put, it is a service that allows governments to monitor, manage, review, and report on all stimulus programs and projects from one location.</p>
<p><a class="external-link" href="http://forms.activestrategy.com/go/activestrategy/nationaldialogue_stimulus_webinar">View a demo of the system during the second half of this recording.</a></p>
<p>StimulusScorecard provides a secure, low-cost system that requires virtually no IT support and can be online and ready to go in days. The package includes ActiveStrategy Enterprise online scorecard software, documentation, training, best practices measurements templates for the ARRA, telephone support, help selecting key measures and objectives to get your system usable right away, and ongoing analysis of OMB guidance. Coaching on how to use the system to conduct reviews of stimulus-funded projects and ARRA strategy is included as well. There is no software to buy or install - governments and agencies pay for the system only for as long as it is needed as part of the management and administrative costs of their stimulus projects.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>ActiveStrategy StimulusScorecard allows federal agency, state, city, and local officials, as well as other Recovery Act recipients, to monitor and manage:</p>
<ul><li>How efficiently and effectively the dollars are being spent in real time (i.e. are the programs on-time, on-budget, and on-quality from their original plan)</li><li>How much impact there is on economic recovery (i.e. what long-term benefits are being realized in job creation, productivity, energy efficiency, etc.)</li><li>Who is responsible for projects and what updates are they providing on performance</li><li>How many projects and how many dollars have been awarded, spent, obligated or are pending<br /></li></ul>

<p>I think it's hard to box submissions into a specific set of categorizations, simply because people use different language and have different mental models.&nbsp; For this kind of open dialogue, I prefer having the community itself contribute its tags as NAPA has done.&nbsp; Perhaps it might be valuable to pre-seed the tags with a set of common categories.&nbsp; Also, a semantic element that can bridge the tags would be helpful for finding related submissions.</p>

<h1>
				Use small OWL ontologies to model recovery and deploy across all government
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>We have build a number of OWL ontologies that model "recovery". The ontologies have constructs for government bodies, agencies, departments, offices and state governments. Indicators of the economics such as consumer price index, unemployment rate, personal consumption expenditures and government consumption expenditures.</p>
<p>This work build off work we started in 2003 when TopQuadrant was co-organizer of the first eGovernment conference at the White House Conference Center on the importance of Semantic Web Technologies for the sharing of data using the web infrastructure.</p>
<p>Some constructs from these ontologies are:</p>
<p>(1) http://www.bea.gov/models/owl/bea.owl#Indicator</p>
<p>(2) http://www.recovery.gov/models/owl/gov.owl#Office</p>
<p>(3) http://www.recovery.gov/models/owl/recovery.owl#Budget</p>
<p>What we propose is deploying these small models across all agencies and offices of government, publishing data against these ontologies and using the aggregation effect of the web to allow timely and accurate reporting of data to gauge (and hopefully propel) economic recovery.</p>
<p>We are interested to work with others in publishing ontologies for economic indicators, government bodies, and a model of "recovery". We have already transformed the egov.gov site into an OWL dataset of agencies and offices of government.&nbsp; These ontologies can be put on the web but we want a mechanism of governance in place before doing so. It is best that this is provided by a US Government Body.</p>
<p>Interested parties should contact TopQuadrant.</p>
<p>Ralph Hodgson - rhodgson at topquadrant.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>XML is not the end of the story, RDF and OWL are the technologies for model-based data sharing. Small models in OWL are effective ways of publishing data. Semantic Web infrastructure now allows linked data to be discoverable, interpretable and actionable.</p>
<p>As Jim Hendler has said "A Small amount of RDF goes a long way".</p>
<p>The government can save cost and improve data quality by using canonical forms of data. With the extensible capabilities of semantic web technologies, the data can be elaborated, transformed, merged and provisioned in many different ways.</p>
<p>Think "data-based" not "database"</p>

<p>A key difference between RDF/OWL and SQL Databases is that in RDF resources have globally unique IDs referenceable outside of the dataset that contains them. Another critical difference is ability to merge or fuse RDF data from different sources based on these global IDs.</p>

<p>It may be possible to create a stovepipe data in RDF if one really puts a lot of effort to keep it that way. By contrasts, it is very hard NOT to have a stovepipe data in other data representations including SQL Databases and XML. Simply because these data models and technologies have not been created from the ground up to make it possible to distribute and merge disparate data and schema. While RDF has been designed specifically with this purpose in mind.</p>

<p>Also, one should not think of OWL ontologies only as metamodels without taxonomies, preferred terms, etc. The way this idea is phrased, proposed ontologies will certainly include the various terminalogy needed to talk about government spending and recovery. For example, specific government agencies, specific projects, specific recovery indicators such as GDP and unemployment rate, etc.</p>

<p>Agreed.&nbsp; An effective service and solution needs to be in place to manage the potentially large volume of allegations through the hotline service and to implement a robust referral system to send allegations for follow-up to the appropriate IG or responsible office.&nbsp; The hotline call center and a sophisticated referral system that combines case tracking and fraud detection can be seamlessly integrated into one solution. &nbsp;This solution should also provide advanced reporting capabilities to ensure transparency to the public at all times. &nbsp;For additional thoughts refer to the Idea posted for <strong></strong><strong><em>Protecting Stimulus Funds from Fraud, Waste and Abuse</em></strong>.</p>

<h1>
				Transparency is More Than Publication: The Role of Citizen Exchange
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Fair to say that Title XV of the Economic Recovery Act requiring transparency has unleashed a tidal wave of pent up energy and justified momentum towards a more open government. The "strings attached" funding provisions ensure that there will be a solid attempt at top down enforcement of transparency for state and local jurisdictions.

But what is "transparency" and why have we committed to achieving it?

Definition

Both the word "transparency" and the transparency paradigm have taken on a common meaning of openness - of doing the government's business in the sunshine. Wikepedia defines transparency in a very broad sense to mean:

"As used in the humanities, it implies openness and accountability. It is a metaphorical extension of the meaning used a “transparent” object is one that can be seen through."

The organizing principles of Title XV seem to imply that transparency is created by making government information available to the public by ensuring publication in a Web portal - recovery.gov. See Section 1525.

&lt;b>&lt;i>Why do we want transparency?&lt;/i>&lt;/b>

The theory behind transparency is not a hard one. By being more transparent government (or any institution) builds trust. Who can colorably argue that being open in most government matters, especially of policy, is not a good thing. (See R.E Oliver, What is Transparency. http://tinyurl.com/by4ppx.) Of course citizens should be able to know how their money is being spent and priorities established. And by having more knowledge, through transparency, at least in theory citizens should better trust their government.

But is that really the way that it works? And is that the way it should and will work under the Economic Recovery Act?

&lt;b>&lt;i>Working towards a more thoughtful expectation.&lt;/i>&lt;/b>

Are we truly defining transparency in the most useful way, and are we clear with ourselves as to what we are trying to achieve in legislating transparency in the Economic Recovery Act? Can we raise our expectations in a more thoughtful way? I would suggest that we are not. We are not setting our expectations for transparency high enough, nor with clarity of purpose that will enable transparency by government to be a sustainable practice. Here are several thoughts that might help.

&lt;i>The Purpose of Citizen Transparency is to Make Better Decisions&lt;/i>

First, we should start by defining clearly what we are trying to accomplish by promoting transparency. Is it enough to be able to say that we are "open" and good things will happen. No.

Isn't the true purpose of transparency to enable citizens to be more informed so that they can help government make better choices? By building transparency, aren't we trying to draw upon the collective knowledge and experience of citizens to increase solution possibilities in decision making? I think so.

I believe that transparency is not simply saying to government - "we don't trust you - therefore we are going to make you publish all of the transactions in which you are involved in a citizen portal." It is more than that. Which leads to the second shortcoming in our expectations - how do we best build transparency and trust?

&lt;i>Transparency Requires More Than Publication, It Requires Citizen Exchange&lt;/i>

Isn't transparency more than the act of publication? Isn't it also discussion and dialogue? It is one thing to create visibility of information, it is quite different to make sure that citizens circulate info "in network" It is the citizen exchange "in network" that creates transparency - not the mere act of publication and search. This is the point. It is the citizen exchange and citizen networks that create value and trust - not the act of publication.

Transparency without the human is simply mechanical. Human elements enable us to make connections that in turn drive info sharing. To achieve transparency the government has to also enable human interaction that allows the data to move, to be exchanged and discussed by citizens and agencies. It is not enough to simply publish it and accept public comment - a structured communication.

&lt;i>Transparency is Created From the Bottom Up, Not the Top Down&lt;/i>

Which leads to the final point. Transparency is created through bottom up exchange, not a top down push of information. Example: Are citizens more likely to recycle because gov publishes scientific data; or because they share that data w each other? This is the sandy shoal for federal governments' legislation of transparency. It is being designed as top down, not bottom up.

President Obama is right on this point. Neighborhoods are the petri dish for effective engagement. As my twitter friend @bashley said so well: The empathy and emotional understanding of the human condition [is] necessary to support citizen exchange of ideas. Empathy and emotional understanding takes place locally - where recovery projects are being implemented.

What this means is simple. Citizens organize in many types of networks. And from a technology standpoint, the design must enable citizens to exchange information at a local level to achieve true transparency - transparency that leads to higher levels of trust and better decisions.

&lt;i>&lt;b>Summary.&lt;/b>&lt;/i>

So the message is simple. First, the purpose of transparency is more than an informed citizenry - it is an active, helpful citizenry; one that expands solutions. Second, transparency is not achieved by the act of publications but through citizen exchange. And third, transparency is always built from the bottom up, not the top down.

This is my hope for the government - that we get transparency right in a way that shows sustainability through results. Once lost, this opportunity will be gone forever.

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Transparency is not achieved through the publication of information and massive data warehousing. This approach to transparency is not only going to be ultimately ineffective, but has a good chance to erode citizen trust. The whole approach being pursued by recovery.gov should in and of itself be critically examined if the goal is to build public involvement and trust.&nbsp;</p>

				Per Capita Spending Map by Congressional District

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>If it can be known, take the amount of spending that goes into congressional districts, (updated over time), and divide it by the population of that district, (because populations of districts are not the same size from one state to another).&nbsp; Grade this spending per capita by color, green seems appropriate, on a map of the United States, a zoom in feature by region would also be nice.&nbsp;One map for all&nbsp;money coming&nbsp;into the district and one map for the stimulus money only.&nbsp; Also a map for&nbsp;the following countries&nbsp;taken each as a whole: Iraq, Afganistan, Isreal, Egypt, Haiti, Liberia.</p>
<p>The color gradiant would work like this, $0 would be&nbsp;white.&nbsp; The district with the absolute most spending would be a dark green.&nbsp; All the districts&nbsp;would have white mixed into the dark green as they compare to that most spending district.&nbsp; Say a district received 75% as much money as the most spent in district.&nbsp; Its color green would be 75% as deep, 75% dark green, 25% white.&nbsp;</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>There's about $50M in the budget for recovery.gov.&nbsp; One architecture that's been suggested would end up costing well over $300M.&nbsp; Another option is very cheap, although heavily manual.&nbsp; I have seen ideas ranging from a vague notion of using open source (presumably assembled and maintained by a systems integrator) to leading edge BI tools.&nbsp; Given the options for spending versus value, there appear to be substantial tradeoffs.&nbsp; In addition, there appear to options for acquiring the solution (i like the service-based options versus the custom build).&nbsp; But, i am not sure that there is a program manager engaged who has run a $50M program before.&nbsp; Recovery.gov is an investment in good government, performance&nbsp;and accountability.&nbsp; Every good information technology solution which offers transformation as big as recovery.gov ought to have a business case that:</p>
<p>--&nbsp;articulates measures of success (is it communication of results or achievement of accountability, and how do you measure it?).</p>
<p>-- evaluates options to acquire the features and functions, as well as business processes needed to achieve success,</p>
<p>-- and tracks or captures benefits recieved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>I worry that there are so many ideas, the likely solution will be high risk and the whole transparency initaitive will die under its own weight.</p>

<h1>
				OIG Stimulus Oversight and Staff Utilization
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>With over 12,000 staff, including about 7,00 auditors several thousand investigators,&nbsp;and large numbers of IT staff, almost all of whom should be available for temporary reassignment to stimulus oversight since this is one of the highest priorities in OIG history, it is unclear why the Recovery Accountability and Transparency (&nbsp;RAT )&nbsp;Board&nbsp;and OIGs&nbsp;cannot use&nbsp;reassigned staff&nbsp;and get off the ground quicker, especially with respect to initial assessmets of recipients capabilities to manage, spend and account for stimulus funds and coordination of federal, state and other oversight groups ( GAO )&nbsp;stimulus oversight actions.Staff and money are available for such action and effective and immediate OIG action to assess the availability of recipient and administering agency processes and controls to reduce or prevent fraud, waste and abuse, rather than long after the fact reporting of problems, is a critical need and use of available staff rather than delayed staff additions is a necessary action for OIGs and the RAT Board..</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>While obtaining information about projects and spending is very important an even more critical immediate need is to determine the extent to which federal, state and local entities&nbsp; have processes, systems and controls available to administer and oversight the huge amounts of funds intended to be expended quickly. This action can, and should be completed before money is disbursed and while the end recipients of the funds ( contractors, etc. ) may not yet be known in many cases the federal and state agencies initially receiving the funds&nbsp;are known and their capabilities to reasonably assure proper spending can be assessed. While the need for fast spending will not permit full corrective actions if serious gaps are noted some immediate corrective will significantly reduce and prevent fraud, waste and abuse, whereas long after the fact identification of large misuse or ineligible use of funds will be of little value to the taxpayer since little actual recoveries result from such late&nbsp;disclosures. Thus, a crash effort using the best of all available OIG staff and a major change in the traditional&nbsp;long after the fact reporting of problems are needed if the public's expectation of OIG as their protector is to be accomplished..</p>
<p>These and other issues needing OIG attention and improvement have previously been forwarded directly to the Council of Inspectors General and the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board but no response or feedback resulted.</p>

<p>Oversight is under resourced NOW, especially at the state and local level where the Recovery Act is being implemented. No one is available for temporary reassignment that will last years, removing even more resources from the other lines of business that are currently short staffed, given what an effective organization could be doing. .05% of revenues is not an appropriate standard...it a measure of current policy.</p>

				Geographically-Remote Data Collection Using IBM/Cognos TM1
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Perhaps the simplest way to collect spreadsheet data from remote locations is to use IBM/Cognos TM1.</p>
<p>The proposed system would&nbsp;consist of a collection of cooperating TM1 servers at Federal, State, Local and Tribal locations.</p>
<p>The clients can submit data either with a desktop Excel add-in or directly over the web.&nbsp; In the case, that the user prefers the Excel-addin, after the data has been incorporated into the worksheet, the user simply presses the function key, F9, to transmit the data to the designated server.&nbsp; No additional protocols are necessary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, TM1 has been in use by worldwide organizations for budgeting and reporting for approximately two decades.&nbsp; The solution has been tested for years</p>
<p>In addition, TM1 communicates readily with most other systems including the IBM Cognos Platform that supports both Financial Performance Management and Business Intelligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>TM1 is perhaps the most elegant solution for the types of financial spreadsheets that regularly appear on the Recovery.gov site.</p>

These days 200% mark up or even higher is quite the norm and having sales and markdowns are eating into the massive profit. To win consumer confidence we need to show a change in the way retial companies operate, instead of comaring financial data from last, they should gage their success on operational profit. This will allow investors and others to gauge organizational succcess while allowing consumers to benefit by knowing that prices are not getting jacked up.</p>

<p>I do believe that the time is right for a change in CEO compensation. I'm not sure if this should come from the Gov. or if private industry boards will spur the shift themselves (to reduce the short term thinking).

<h1>
				A single solution.  Let's not try to bolt too many parts together.
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>With simplicity comes transparency.&nbsp; Just think how the government does things now.&nbsp; Not a single bill can be passed without the addition of some kind of pork brought about by a deal – nowhere near a simple transaction.&nbsp; The is our money and we need to be able to<em> easily</em> identify where every dollar was spent, <strong><em>including all of the side deals</em></strong> after the money is handed out.&nbsp; Simplicity guarantees that the user, any user, will be able to understand what they are seeing or what they want to see, without having to navigate though a labyrinth of poorly designed screens.&nbsp; Good software can do this – handle the complexity behind the scenes so that everything is simple to the end user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most importantly, we do not want to spend tens of millions of dollars building a system to do what is already commercially available off-the-shelf.&nbsp; Furthermore, the bulk of the stimulus money will be spent if we take the time to custom-build something, so that’s simply not an option</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that every dollar spent, every single dollar, must be supported by a contract.&nbsp; The true solution is to track the spend by contract at the receiving end.&nbsp; Every dollar passed to a state has to be documented, followed and available for reporting out of the OMB, and every dollar awarded on a contract by the state that received the money, must exactly balance the money granted by the OMB.&nbsp; Simple accounting.&nbsp; If it doesn’t balance, we’ll know about it instantly, through email or other kinds of alerts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ecteon has been installing contract management systems since the mid-80s.&nbsp; We have installations in federal and state government agencies.&nbsp; The system is ready to go to provide an audit trail of every dollar spent and alerts for any part of any contract spending.&nbsp; Ecteon is 100% American, based in New York; 100% of our employees are American and we do no offshoring of any kind.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ecteon.com">www.ecteon.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that there may be a naive impression that given the amount of transparency and accountability called for by this act, no or little fraud will occur. My 38 years of federal enforcement experience tells me that some level of waste and fraud is unfortunately inevitable," Mr. Devaney told state officials charged with coordinating the spending. - Washington Times, March 13, 2009</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our objective, which should also be yours is to prove Earl Devaney wrong - that we will track every dollar and if one goes unaccounted, we will immediately know where to look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The <em>complete</em> solution already exists, so we won't waste time and money writing a lot of custom code.</p>
<p>We won't have to bolt together a bunch of dissimilar systems to create a hybrid.</p>
<p>Everything will be on&nbsp;a central common database making analysis and reporting an easy task.</p>
<p>Its a <strong>100% American</strong> solution.</p>

<p>I agree with the idea of a "single system approach".&nbsp; It is ironic that the Federal Government collects and appropriates money as a single entity yet does not have a truly effective single system for tracking spending and progress against results.&nbsp; It is important to note that measuring progress is key as a part of the effort -- not just tracking spending or distribution of funds.</p>

Minimum standards would vary from program to program but by example, each project must create/ save a certain number of jobs, reduce CO<sub>2</sub> by a minimum amount of tons, increase energy efficiencies, etc.</p>
<p>For those fund requests that meet minimum requirements, the recipients and/or the Agencies need to decide which projects provide better desired results over others. Essentially the projects with the better ROI should be funded. Not ROI in the simplest economic form but an analytical model of Key Performance Metrics (KPIs) that takes into account factors important to the specific Recovery program objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The projects are assessed against these KPIs and strategic planning of use and distribution of funding is conducted. In order to create true transparency into Recovery Fund spending, recipients and agencies must be able to compile, store and analyze data from multiple sources.&nbsp; Then, and most importantly, they must be able transform that data into knowledge.&nbsp; Only then will they be able to create transparency into how, when and where funds were spent thus enabling accountability to the American public.</p>

<p>American taxpayers deserve the best available technology and
4 Tell Solutions has it right now. The company has an excellent, proven product and an
(international) reputation for integrity. Senior management at 4 Tell Solutions understand the
stimulus-fund related metrics that the federal government needs from state and local
governments in coming years, and they have invested heavily in the infrastructure necessary to deliver these much-needed knowledge-based solutions. I believe 4 Tell Solutions’ “iplan” product gives
the federal government the best chance to guarantee that taxpayer dollars are
spent the most efficiently and effectively. If we want <u>useful,</u> transparent
real-world knowledge emanating from stimulus funding expenditures, 4 Tell
Solutions has the answer. No other company has a product that is anything
like iplan…it is consistent, and interacts easily, with every major
federal program out there. As an expert on state and local energy programs for
more than 20-years, and as an advocate of stronger, more meaningful metrics for
Department of Energy programs, I believe the federal government should use
iplan immediately.</p>

<p>I agree, but with the caveat that the taxonomy needs to balance "comprehensiveness" with "manageability." It's really easy to say "simple," but it can be darn hard to actually pull that off. I'm sure whatever group gets tasked with nailing down the taxonomy is going to be pressured to incorporate everything under the sun. Not only will this make the taxonomy NOT simple, but it will lead to an undue burden on the various data creators.</p>

				Use a Research Management Solution
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>			
			Use a Research Management Solution (RMS) to track the due diligence performed by the government agencies tasked with distributing stimulus funds. An RMS can systematically capture and organize the unstructured information required for the analysis of stimulus investments. RMS has been successfully adopted by money managers all over the globe as a way to create an open and transparent collaboration among analysts, power better choices for decision-makers, and create a structured audit trail of analysis.
			
			
			<h2>Why is it important?</h2>	
			99% of the world's information is unstructured: email correspondence, documents, spreadsheets, slide decks. While quantitative analysis is critical, many of the most important decisions are driven by human discourse – in words not just numbers. Research Management Solutions transform the cacophony of disparate email inboxes and shared drives into a structured database shared in real time across global organizations. To provide complete transparency for the public, the agencies responsible for application of stimulus funds need to track their internal assessments. These assessments will include large bodies of correspondence and prose analysis. Research Management Solutions can transform the potentially chaotic investment research process into a coherent, organized, and agency-wide effort.

<p>I agree - this is an idea for the Federal Goverment agencies. Accountability needs to start at the top. The agencies tasked with dispersing stimulus funds are effectively running the world's largest private equity fund. Sunshine is the best disinfectant - the easiest way to prevent waste is to ensure the entire process is transparent and open. That should include the research and due diligence conducted by the federal agencies on the downstream programs.</p>

				 XBRL: The standard for Pubic Sector Fiscal Reporting &amp; Transparency
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The Security and Exchange Commission is requiring companies to report their financial data in XBRL format. The use of XBRL will allow financial documents to be easily searchable, comparable and interactive. In addition, the standard will allow organizations a common financial language for ingesting, storing and shipping financial data around SOA based systems.&nbsp; So what is XBRL? XBRL stands for eXtensible Business Reporting Language and it is being developed by both businesses and government agencies from around the world. This standard will be the basis for financial reporting in the United States. It is based on the open standard of XML and is free to anyone who wants to use/support it. The use of XBRL would stream the financial reporting process between all public sector agencies and thus allow a common standard for all public and private sector organizations to share information in a common language.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>XBRL provides a common reporting language for both public and private sector organizations and would streamline agency reporting. It's already adopted by industries across the globe so we have a proven standard with technologies from all vendors and open communities already in place.&nbsp; October 15th is approaching rapidly and we do not have the luxury of creating a 'new' standard/technology. Many states and locals already have the infrastructure in place. We are ready to go.</p>

<p>cmeade nailed it. Consistency and uniformity of data needs to be enforced at the lowest level possible in the process and that will be impossible (or at least extremely difficult) without clear data definitions and standards that are enforced from the top down.</p>

<p>Everyone in the private sector is accustomed to having to meet the data standards for the company at which they work. There is no reason government agencies should be exempt from the communication and standards the rest of us have to meet. The standards defined should apply to all data between agencies and then they can be supplemented to meet the additional requirements of each agency. For example, The FCC doesn't need to know seed types any more than the more than Agriculture needs to know radio frequencies but both agencies need to report dollars, headcount, and disbursements to state and local agencies and institutions the same way. The SEC would hang out to dry the pelt of any company that tried to play as fast and loose with their bottom line numbers as these agencies do regularly.</p>

<h1>
				Middleware to Normalize Data
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Defining the process and data requirements to track and report on stimulus dollars is obviously a very daunting task.&nbsp; What data items should be collected?&nbsp; What format should it be collected in and how frequently should it be reported.&nbsp; How do you know that the data being reported is coming from a authoritative source? Should that data collection be centralized or decentralized? Once the data is collected how should it be made publically available to government and its citizens to view and analyze.&nbsp; These are all good questions that I’m sure very smart people are working on.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is however a common set of services that should be in place to help automate this type of solution regardless of the answers to the questions above.&nbsp; The process of loading data into a database from multiple data sources in a variety of data formats is typically referred to as Extract-Transform-Load (<strong>ETL</strong>).&nbsp; It is probably safe to say that Recovery.gov will need the ability to take information from one or more sources, normalize it in some way to a defined schema, and then insert it into a repository or database.</p>
<p>Merging data from heterogeneous data stores into a single, consistent dataset is always challenging.&nbsp; Most government organizations archive information into legacy data systems and each may use a different data storage technology to store the data. &nbsp;The data may also be presented in multiple file formats and layouts making data cleansing an important step in this process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the data can be used, it may need to be formatted differently depending on the number of prescribed data formats. &nbsp;The Recovery.gov solution will also need the ability to pull and have data pushed to its data store in a variety of standards based formats including flat files, excel and XML and should require the use of standard web transport protocols such as SOAP, REST and or RSS feeds.</p>
<p><br />So the challenge is finding a set of tools that can help automate and track the ETL process.&nbsp; Most ETL solutions today require a developer to code the transformation logic using either XSLT and or a common programming language such as J2EE or .NET.&nbsp; In the perfect world you would want to find an ETL tool that requires little to no custom code, if custom code is required the tool should provide a common set of API’s.&nbsp; You would also want one that is based on industry standards and transport protocols and is simple to use.&nbsp; There are several tools on the market today that fit into this category one of which is SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).&nbsp; Without writing a single line of code, you can create SSIS solutions (packages) that solve complex business problems using ETL and business intelligence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integration Services could help Recovery.gov connect to a wide variety of standard data sources, including multiple OLTP sources in a single solution. It can also connect to multiple flat files, XML and Excel files and includes components that can parse and extract the data from flat files, Excel spreadsheets, XML documents as well as tables and views in relational databases. The data consumed by SSIS is typically transformed by one or more of the transformations. Integration Services includes built-in transformations that you can add to clean and standardize data, change the case of data, convert data to a different type or format, or create new column values based on expressions. For example, you could concatenate the first and last name columns into a single full name column, and then change the characters to uppercase. You can also clean data by replacing the values in columns with values from a reference table, using either an exact lookup or fuzzy lookup. For example, the SSIS solution could first attempt to look up a stimulus project name in the reference table by using the primary key value of the project. When this search fails to return the project name, it would attempt the search again, this time using fuzzy matching on the project name. &nbsp;In that example the solution ran the extract lookup first then applied the fuzzy lookup.&nbsp; There is also an SSIS transformation that cleans data by grouping values in a dataset that are similar. This is useful for identifying records that may be duplicates. For example, by comparing addresses in project records you could identify a number of duplicate projects. There are way too many transformations to discuss in detail here but you get the idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final step in any ETL process is usually to load the cleansed data into one or more data bases. &nbsp;I’m not sure what database will be selected for Recovery.gov so the tool selected will need to be flexible.&nbsp; SSIS can load data into a variety of familiar OLTP data destinations including ORACLE and SQL Server and can also produce flat files if required.</p>
<p>Defining the data collection requirements and process is definitely a daunting task.&nbsp; As the processes begin to become more clear the tools and services to support them need to be flexible enough to change as needed to support the goals of the new administration.&nbsp; SSIS could definitely prove to be a valuable asset in the ETL toolbox</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Transparency and accountability can only be achieved if the data that is collected and reported on is done so accurately. Although there are many steps in this process that need to be managed an integral part of that process is the extraction, transformation and loading of that data into one or more authoritative data destinations.</p>

<h1>
				Adopt recommendations on open government from ACM
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>			
			As many have jumped into making recommendations on how Recovery data  should be packaged and disseminated, I'm reminded of some important previous work in this area.

The first is the <a href="http://www.acm.org/public-policy/open-government">ACM U.S. Public Policy Committee (USACM) Recommendations on Open Government</a>.  I have a tremendous respect for the ACM as  "the world’s largest educational and scientific computing society".  The <a href="http://usacm.acm.org/usacm/about.html">ACM U.S. Public Policy Committee (USACM)</a>
<p> "serves as the focal point for ACM's interaction with U.S. government organizations, the computing community, and the U.S. public in all matters of U.S. public policy related to information technology."   The policy statement on "open government"  first sets the context for its recommendations:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><em>Individual citizens, companies and organizations have begun to use computers to analyze government data, often creating and sharing tools that allow others to perform their own analyses. This process can be enhanced by government policies that promote data reusability, which often can be achieved through modest technical measures. But today, various parts of governments at all levels have differing and sometimes detrimental policies toward promoting a vibrant landscape of third-party web sites and tools that can enhance the usefulness of government data</em>.<br /><br /></blockquote>
The recommendations  "for data that is already considered public information" are:
<div>
<ul>
<li> Data published by the government should be in formats and approaches that promote analysis and reuse of that data.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li> Data republished by the government that has been received or stored in a machine-readable format (such as online regulatory filings) should preserve the machine-readability of that data.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li> Information should be posted so as to also be accessible to citizens with limitations and disabilities.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li> Citizens should be able to download complete datasets of regulatory, legislative or other information, or appropriately chosen subsets of that information, when it is published by government.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li> Citizens should be able to directly access government-published datasets using standard methods such as queries via an API (Application Programming Interface).</li></ul>
<ul>
<li> Government bodies publishing data online should always seek to publish using data formats that do not include executable content.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li> Published content should be digitally signed or include attestation of publication/creation date, authenticity, and integrity.</li></ul>
</div>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>ACM, as a professional organization of computer scientists and practitioners, is able to speak for a broad range of computer scientists in the matter of policy recommendations.&nbsp; The principles articulated by the ACM have real-world practical implications without getting wrapped up in potentially distracting implementation details and hence should have wide applicability, including to the specific context of recovery.gov</p>

<p>ACM's ideas nicely summarize the important things about open data from the government: it must be made available in ways which are based on easily usable and freely available tools. Also, security issues are important, so data formats alowing embedded code (such as macros) often are not such a good idea. Solving the signature/authentication issues will be a really tough topic, but if documents are well-identified (such as by URI), they can at least be verified by repeating downloads and thus re-validating the document's authenticity.</p>

				Citizen Usability and "Being Meaningful"
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>This inspiring opportunity to deliver accountability and transparency will only take hold in the public psyche if it incorporates insights from the cognitive and behavioral sciences (especially cognitive semantics) to make the information meaningful, useful, and engaging for citizens.</p>
<p>I strongly encourage the board to consider the role that psychology, linguistics, neuroscience and related fields have to offer in structuring the concepts that organize information and the interfaces that deliver visualization and interaction to members of the public who want to know how the government is spending our money.</p>
<p>For example, the board should consider the <strong>Cognitive Criterion for Public Support </strong>as a guiding principle:</p>
<p><em>An effective policy must be popular if it is to stand the test of time
and it must be popular for the right reasons, namely because it
promotes the right long-term values in the minds of citizens,
reinforced through the lived experience.</em></p>
<p>This is true for the public interface that tracks government spending just as it is for the national parks, social security, and other social programs.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>In the past, technical experts (e.g. wonks) have developed government solutions in a manner that failed to adequately engage the imagination of the populace.&nbsp; What we need now is to promote civic engagement around meaningful and coherent presentations of government function to promote trust in our democratic system - something that has been sorely lacking for decades.&nbsp; Recovery.org has the potential to capture public imagination if it is put together thoughtfully and takes seriously the role that public meaning has as people experience this program.</p>

<p>Adobe Flex can provide some good out of the box visualization technologies for the web environment. However, we've built several flash/flex-based visualzation engines and there can be tremendous limitations and performance issues - especially if you're dealing with large databases driving the visualization engine. I recommend Ajax-based componentry as it provides better optimization potential and better ability to integrate with other "mashup" components.</p>

				Get the Public's Data onto TheDataWeb 
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau has already created an online network of over a thousand&nbsp;public databases.&nbsp; Using open source software,&nbsp;TheDataWeb is essentially the Internet for public databases. &nbsp;DataFerrett&nbsp;browses TheDataWeb and gives data users the ability to&nbsp;create custom tables based on millions of records on the fly without requiring memory-consuming&nbsp;periodic downloads into large, relational database software.&nbsp; DataFerrett has metadata that works with almost all database software&nbsp;and even&nbsp;incorporates statistical intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report-writing software known as HotReports can display data in web pages with&nbsp;interactive maps, graphs and tables that anyone can use or understand, making data much more accessible.</p>
<p>Many federal, state and private organizations such as Harvard/MIT have made their data available through DataFerrett.&nbsp;&nbsp; This program needs a high-level&nbsp;advocate to secure funding and obtain permissions from the holders of public data&nbsp;beginning with federal agencies, allowing DataFerrett to access&nbsp;the public's data live at the source.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a class="external-link" href="http://dataferrett.census.gov/">http://dataferrett.census.gov/</a></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The more information in the hands of the public as well as decision-makers, the better we can assess the&nbsp;need for&nbsp;and impact of government spending, including stimulus monies.&nbsp; Demographic, economic, health and education statistics&nbsp;could all be found in one place instead of in many separate locations&nbsp;that require users to learn different formats and software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justification for government grants could include objective measures to a&nbsp;greater degree than is now possible.&nbsp; Expansion of&nbsp;TheDataWeb would ensure decisions for funding of public projects are based on the most current, comprehensive and statistically sound data available.&nbsp;It would&nbsp;make it harder for&nbsp;partisan administrations in the future to suppress any data it did not find politically palatable.&nbsp;Government would be more transparent and the public more informed,&nbsp;the hallmarks of democracy.&nbsp;</p>

				Using recovery.gov data for analysis and prediction of mpact
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The large volume of data that will be collected on Recovery.com offers an opportunity to apply advanced data analytics to understand the impact, both intended and unintended, of ARRA investments.&nbsp; A key question is the speed with which ARRA investments will start to demonstrate quantifiable return on investment (ROI) in terms of job creation and other tangible measures of economic recovery.&nbsp; The above mission statement mentions for instance the objective of estimating of how many jobs are being created.&nbsp; There could be a role here for fairly sophisticated analytical models that, for example, isolate the impact of ARRA investments on job creation and other primary and secondary measures of economic health at the level of either the state or Congressional District.&nbsp; Understanding and analyzing the link between investments and concrete outcomes (new jobs, improved health) and their explicit (job creation) or implicit (use of public transportation, gas consumption) measurements requires a combination of expertise that includes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Macro economists </li><li>Labor-based economist</li><li>Econometrics </li><li>Data management skills</li><li>Experts in demographic and other public data sources</li><li>Statistical modeling</li><li>Machine learning for validation of causal relationships</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analytical models would require temporal (e.g. monthly) data on ARRA investment by category (see different groupings on the Recovery.com site) and measurements of direct and indirect indicators of economic health. In addition, detailed demographic data is needed at the same level to allow controls for non-ARRA related effects.&nbsp; Such models could provide evidence for the relative success of recovery investments and can also provide insight on optimal allocation of certain types of investments against types of districts in terms of their demographic composition. &nbsp;Graphical and causal modeling will further establish a more sophisticated view of the cause-and-effect relationship between ARRA investments and indicators of recovery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovery.gov encourages anyone to visit the site and share their stories on how the recovery act is impacting them as individuals.&nbsp; This information provides a wealth of insight into how and where ARRA is succeeding and failing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Advanced data analytics models could be developed to mine all such posts and determine the topic discussed in each posting, as well as the sentiment expressed relative to this topic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further processing of these results could present intriguing trends at the grass-roots level that will allow officials to assess the impact by geographical sector (i.e. Congressional District), by government agency overseeing aspects of the recovery plan, and by the specifics of each spending initiative.&nbsp; This insight, coupled with the more traditional economic modeling discussed above, could paint a very unique picture of the evolving recovery from both a top-down and bottoms-up perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the expertise identified above, this analysis of individual feedback would require the following skills:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Unstructured information management</li><li>Natural language processing for feature extraction from unstructured content</li><li>Machine learning in high-dimensional spaces</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Timely analysis of data from recovery.gov, particularly when combined with other data reported by states and regions, will provide both ordinary citizens and our elected and appointed leaders with deeper understanding of the impact of spending on local and national objectives. It will enable us to more quicklet determine what "works"&nbsp;which can lead to more effective use of our nation's resources.</p>

<p>Note that these tasks would require that ARRA data be joined (linked) with data from other sources such as demographic databases, labor statistics on job creation and unemployment, energy consumption, income generation, and other indicators of economic health. These tasks would also be tailored and focused for each particular investment type. For example, the analysis and models used to predict cause and effect relationships of investments in labor training (i.e. directly affects labor supply) would be much different than investments made directly for building energy efficiency (i.e. directly affects demands for jobs).&nbsp;</p>

These tasks would also be tailored and focused for each particular investment type. For example, the analysis and models used to predict cause and effect relationships of investments in labor training (i.e. directly affects labor supply) would be much different than investments made directly for building energy efficiency (i.e. directly affects demands for jobs).&nbsp;

				Information I would like to see on my state and town.
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I would like to be able to look at the broad category of stimulus funds, for example education, and look at the distribution of funds by state, by town, to be able to see exactly how much money my town received and how the money was spent.&nbsp; For example, were new textbooks, new hardware, or new software purchased?&nbsp; Which school(s) benefited?&nbsp; How many teacher's jobs were saved or created?</p>
<p>(I think it is critical to be able to as accurate a number as possible to know how many jobs were saved or created for each line item.)</p>
<p>Each line item, from the state to the town level, should have a unique identification number, a contact number for the project at that level and a different contact number to report discrepancies or fraud.</p>
<p>If a particular category of funds was declined by the governor of the state, this should be clearly documented as well.</p>
<p>If any projects have a timeline, such as infrastructure projects, it would be nice to see the approximate start and end dates.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>I am sure that many other taxpayers would like to see and track the same information that I would like to see and track on recovery.gov.</p>

<p>If one really wants to get down to the micro level of stimulus reporting, this makes sense. And it seems to be a stated goal of ARRA to account for every dollar. Reporting could be done through the use of some other ideas that I have seen on this website such as widget deployment and use of Web Services and XML.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can we not have a national clearing house website to indicate where jobs may be available, allowing job/employee matches with direct links to application forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People who agreed to move to a new location might be able to get a significant tax deduction to cover moving expenses, or in some cases an emergency stipend to help with a move.</p>
<p>It would be important to have employers&nbsp;NOT list jobs for which they probably already have an inhouse solution</p>

<p>Not only would job shortages be filled quickly, with people able to search for jobs for which they may be qualifed, they could also consider work&nbsp;they never knew existed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a crucial idea!&nbsp; One of the major concerns in building recovery.gov is meeting the public's demands for the type of information they deem important -- where to find and apply for jobs created by Recovery $ is not a clear process at this early stage.&nbsp; A number of options exist including links to state and local sites that could list job opportunities, use of national sites such as Monster.com (as noted in a comment) are options.&nbsp; It is difficult to manage such a job matching process on the national level, so local solutions linked to the national site would seem to be a good answer.&nbsp; While there are numerous legislatively prescribed purpooses for Recovery.gov, creating jobs is obviously at the core of the Act. Any workable means to match job seekers with job openings would be useful. &nbsp;Any specific ideas in this arena would be helpful!!!</p>

<p>Great idea! Marry this up to the geo/mapping-based ideas, and you've got a winner. I'm sure the list of fields would need to be 4-5 times as long...but allowing some level of user-created fields (distributed -- mapping back to a project ID that is then managed in a master hierarchy...or master hierarchies). This really could work.&nbsp;</p>

Interesting idea.
<p>Sounds kind of like a cross between facebook and a Scoop-based blog. It would make a lot of sense as a stand-alone site, in addition to the main site (to keep the main reporting site more secure from scripting exploits, etc.). Set up sub-sites (using a clickable map and/or zip code/nearest major city for navigation?) per region (Northeast, Southwest, Southeast, etc.) of the country, breaking down from there to state, then county, then community level. Individuals would register by zip code, and could post content related to local projects. They could also post and comment regarding projects in other areas, since people do travel, but there could be a filter option to view comments/posts by locals for any given project. Using a scoop-like ratings system for community moderation of content would make it easier to keep the quality of commentary reasonable.</p>

				Simple is Smart: Use Plain Language to Turn Data into Information
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Government often speaks to itself using acronyms, bureaucratic jargon and puffery. If "governmentese" seeps into the recovery.gov website it will distance Americans&nbsp;from the program leaving them vulnerable to biased interpreters. We need to ensure that the reams of data which are being captured about funding and spending the stimulus are displayed in clear, understandable terms. For example, "shovel-ready" is an immediately understandable concept using familiar terminology. Don't turn it into "permit ratified, eco-system investigated, infrastructure-focussed initiative" when it reaches the website.</p>
<p>Since graphs&nbsp;are a key technique for conveying statistical data,the principles of good information design&nbsp;must also be followed.&nbsp;Graphs that are so overloaded with information that they are unintelligible will remain unread and useless. Be wary of the pie with so many slices that you can't discern one from another. Previously submitted ideas that suggest the ability to enter a zip code, area of interest, topic, etc. to zero in on information of interest are excellent and will help users of the site to winnow down the content they see.</p>
<p>Use the common sense test. If&nbsp;anyone's brother, mother, grandfather or aunt wouldn't be able to understand the data and its significance to his or her life, don't post it or clarify it until they could.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a rule of thumb, &nbsp;Simple is Smart.</p>

<h1>
				Interactive web-based heat maps to explore the context of Recovery spending
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>It’s important for the government to identify the
sweet spot
between ease of use and analytical power when making Recovery data
available to
the public. One fairly intuitive method to enable the public to
contextualize
and evaluate ARRA expenditures would be through the use of a heat map.
Users
would be able to select from a variety of factors relating to
population demographics
(e.g. age, educational attainment, household income, etc.),
geographical factors (e.g. proximity to an airport, proximity to
existing sewer infrastructure), labor statistics
(e.g. unemployment) or health data (e.g. lung cancer incidence, heart
disease mortality).
A user weights the factors that are of interest to them positively or
negatively using simple slider bars. Map algebra is then used to
generate a heat map that conveys the suitability of a
given site as a product of all the factors and weights.</p>
<p>This resulting raster heat map would be overlaid with other kinds of data: point data of government investment sites or feature data such as the location of airports, rail
lines, public transit routes, floodplains, zoning information, or any other
information that will put spending into context.</p>
<p>The simple interface of a site like this also makes it easy for
non-specialists (most Recovery.org visitors) to use, while
enabling fairly sophisticated analysis. Since different factors will be
relevant to different kinds of stimulus spending, relevant variables
can be packaged into different scenarios. You can try this out at mapAsheville's Priority Places: http://bit.ly/ashevillePP</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Accountability. Taxpayers want to know if ARRA funding is
going to the areas where it will be most productive. The thematic maps proposed
elsewhere would only allow users to look at a site in the context of a single
thematic variable, but heat maps would allow users to weight a number of variables and visualize the landscape in the context of all of these considerations combined.</p>

<h1>
				Use Web Architecture and Web Technologies to make recovery data available
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Access to recovery.gov data should be based on RESTful HTTP use, specifically on using feeds for delivering updates to data, and using HTML/XML for representing the data itself. Our <q><a href="http://isd.ischool.berkeley.edu/stimulus/2009-029/">Proposed Guideline Clarifications for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a></q> proposed and implemented such an approach. These clarifications are not complete and should not be implemented exactly as proposed, but they lead the way towards an approach directly rooted in Web architecture and Web technologies.</p>
<p>RESTful Web services need some time to get used to them, but they deliver significant value because they do not require a specialized tool set to work with. recovery.gov could serve as a test-bed for making government data available through RESTful Web services, and the lessons learned there could be applied to the bigger project of implementing data.gov.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the Recovery Act has been created to create jobs, foster innovation, and improve infrastructure. Using RESTful Web services for implementing recovery.gov not only would be an innovative way of implementing an open government, it would also help to become more competitive in this emerging area of a Web that moves from traditional centralized IT approach to a more loosey coupled approach of information management.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Access to the services and data made available by recovery.gov should not be based on formats and/or protocols which introduce unnecessary hurdles. The <a href="http://journal.webscience.org/46/">Plain Web</a> follows the idea that for each task, the simplest tool available should be chosen. The Web is a information system that has been built on the foundations of identification by URI, data access by HTTP, and data representation by HTML/XML. to ensure the widest possible audience, access to recovery data should be built on these principles. RESTful use of HTTP, delivering XML, is the easiest possible implementation in that space, and allows access by the widest possible range of users and devices, ranging from large-scale data access to direct to recovery.gov data from mobile devices, such as iPhones and other mobile Internet platforms.</p>
<p>Additional layers of technology (such as SOAP from the Web services domain, or RDF/OWL from the Semantic Web domain) dramatically reduce the number of potential consumers, without providing sufficient benefit to justify such a reduction.</p>

<p>It IS important for transparency that this information is presented before all the decisions for award are made. Some people do not relate well to graphic representation of data. Simplified explanation along with charts woluld be helpful. Never forget that all Americans are not financial or IT experts! But, we ALL need to know what's going on.</p>

				Rich Interactive Diagrams
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The current site seems to have several complex diagrams laced throughout, that could really garner high value in using rich, interactive versions of the diagrams. &nbsp;For example, the first featured diagram of green buildings on the home page, could be an interactive Silverlight or Flash diagram that would allow users to "click and zoom" into each key area, view a quick related video on how each section will be executed on, and finally link to the current destination page for further reading.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Moving to more of an interactive approach in a tactful manner, would not only make the site more usable, keep visitors interested in the data being displayed, but would allow users to "drill down" into live data, view related videos, and then allow them to read further in the current workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a graceful downgrade user experience in place would definitely be key here - i.e. if interactive plug-in is not installed, allow for current static experience to be shown.</p>

<h1>
				Follow the money ... or Focus on Outcomes?
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Many contibutors will have much better ideas than me on tracking the funds and developing greater transparency in the spending. My concern is the inevitable question: "and what did we get for that?"</p>
<p>And the answer should be in terms we can all understand. Luckily, there's an ISO standard that helps - ISO 9001:2008 IWA 4.&nbsp; This standard describes the expectations of a "reliable local government."</p>
<p>The really&nbsp;applicable item regarding reporting&nbsp;in IWA 4 is the so-called "check-up system" that is incorporated into the standard. The check up includes 39 indicators of performance, divided among 4 areas of social responsibility:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Institutional development of good government</li><li>Sustainable economic development</li><li>Inclusive social development</li><li>Sustainable environmental development</li></ol>
<p>What makes this framework worthy?</p>
<ul><li>First, it focuses on&nbsp;outcomes. </li><li>Second, it uses language that citizens understand (which may include Congressional committees!). </li></ul>
<p>And since it can be applied in a common reference model, the federal government can choose the 2-4 indicators in each quadrant that ALL stimulus recipients must report on (so you can get a national perspective), with the remaining indicators availalble for use by States and local governments to choose from that may be most meaningful to their constituents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Accounting is not transparency. One might think that adding up the numbers tells us something, but I suspect it helps foster hearings, not outcomes.</p>
<p>Most citizens will not know nor care how well anyone did at their FACTS II budget execution reporting. I grudgingly acknowledge it will be neccessary, just as it is probably necessary to know how much water was used to put out a fire. But stopping the fire is the important result. Protecting lives and property is meaningful. The cost of gasoline and water, not so much.</p>
<p>So my analogy may be silly. But it's meant to point us toward a more meaningful context for knowing "what did we get" for the spending. The IWA 4 framework offers that kind of outcome-based consideration of the results.</p>
<p>I am also confident that any good IT service provider can easily build an XBRL&nbsp;reference model for tagging IWA 4 indicators and mapping them to business functional&nbsp;and financial data reporting.</p>
<p>Then you can power-up Recovery.gov to dynamically generate outcome metrics by any level of government that a citizen would like to see, as well as revealing the underlying data. But now it will have context and meaning that even my Dad (79) and son (17) can understand.</p>

<p>If we are going to try and communicate the measure of success in government to its citizens, then it must be done in terms that most people can understand. The terms of success are only really measured by outcomes. The citizens must be able to share perspectives which are enabled by common understanding and apply to the benefits derived by society's investment in government outcomes.</p>

				Communication is Key
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Each state will have some control over how the stimulus money will be applied locally.&nbsp; It will assist the public to know that their interests are kept in mind if there are local ‘stimulus czars’ to lend a voice to certain areas.&nbsp; These czars will be selected off country groups and council boards.&nbsp; Each state depending on size and money distributed will be allotted various czars throughout their counties.&nbsp; They will have monitoring capability of money spent in their areas and offer ‘town halls’ to discuss progress being made with the money in their areas.&nbsp; Additionally, each county website will have a stimulus countdown and weekly update on how money was distributed and utilized.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Most people feel their concerns are not always looked at it when it comes to a change from what they consider the norm. This has been seen quite often in cities when a Base Closure has occurred or a new system&nbsp;is utilized at an already established organization.&nbsp; Town Halls are effective in&nbsp;reassuring the public&nbsp;that their interests are taken into account.</p>

				Tell citizens who is working on projects and where the work is being done.

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Include "on the ground" information about where and how funded projects are performed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>As I see it, the ultimate goal of tracking the funding is to have 300 Million watchdogs actually looking at the projects and saying "This project is receiving $X Million of federal stimulus money.&nbsp; Does that seem right ?&nbsp; Are the taxpayers getting their moneys worth - or is something wrong here ?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any federal, state or local agency receiving stimulus money should report how the money is being spent at the lowest level of granularity in an easy to use format. The weekly financial and activity report can be a template upon which to add&nbsp;more data fields.</p>
<p>Example: The Department of Health and Human Services has an item "(75-1516 2009 \ 2010) Payments to States for the Child Care and Development Block Grant - Recovery Act".&nbsp; Include data on how much money was dispersed to each state and then more data on how each state allocated the money for Child Care and Development purposes.&nbsp;Provide the name of every government and non-profit agency that received this money for the purpose of child care.&nbsp;Then report on how many children were cared for, the number of hours they were cared for, the number of adults who cared for them, etc.</p>
<p>Under Accountability and Transparency, there is a page with information on reporting Waste, Fraud and Abuse. Included on that page is the following:</p>
<p><em>"As money begins to flow to grant and contract recipients, the public may become aware of potential fraud that should be investigated to ensure the Recovery Act funds are spent properly"</em></p>
<p>Including comprehensive information on the use of these funds at the&nbsp;FINAL POINT OF EXPENDITURE will give citizens the tools they need to assure that the money is being spent effectively and for the stated purpose.</p>

				Consumer friendly “App Store” to best serve citizens and developers
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Recovery.gov should create and promote the equivalent of an “iPhone app store” which would allow recovery data to be easily accessed, analyzed and/or combined &nbsp;with other data so that it could be visualized in a variety of meaningful ways.<br /><br />Recovery.gov seeks to make all recovery data available to as many people as possible in an open and transparent fashion, and in ways that make it easy for them to use the data in whatever way they see fit, to reach their own conclusions about how the U.S. government is spending stimulus money.<br /><br />There are far more people in the general population who can benefit from tools to explore and understand recovery data than there are people within government who are responsible for publishing the data. This would also invite/allow any developer who has the skills to create novel and useful visualizations of data to do so, bringing many more resources to bear than recovery.gov could on its own.<br /><br />The question is: “how should recovery.gov support them?”<br /><br />An “app store” along the lines used by Apple to support application developers and consumers would promote a consumer-friendly environment where one could host and download small, targeted, flexible applications that can be created and submitted by anyone.<br /><br />Features of the “app store” might include:<br /><br />•<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Simple methods for developers to publish apps.<br />•<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Pre-publication review and curation of apps — sort of an Underwriters Laboratory seal of good practice.</span></p>
<ul><li><span class="Apple-style-span">A directory service for all published apps that enables people to identify apps of potential interest using several methods, e.g.: by searching, browsing, following recommendations, etc.</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span">A simple, consistent model for how an app is depicted and described (e.g., logo, sequence of screen shots, right hand column description, etc.)</span></li><li><span class="Apple-style-span">A secure fulfillment mechanism that supports monetization (or not), updates, and analytics.</span></li></ul>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Most government web sites are tediously complex. We need a true consumer-friendly service platform that enables all parties, regardless of technical sophistication, to access data, create value through their use and interpretation of it, and communicate value by publishing web services and apps that encapsulate their methods. Recovery.gov’s app store should be accessible in a way that is agile, evolutionary, and driven by the needs of the data consumers (U.S. citizens) rather than data producers (federal government agencies). &nbsp;In short, let’s make recovery.gov useful to the “average Joe.”<br /></span></p>

<p>Second, I'd suggest that it shouldn't/wouldn't be the government that would receive any money for apps - it would be the developers of the apps.

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Having an effective performance management strategy in place is important to foster accountability, cost efficiency and transparency of the Recovery and Reinvestment Act. CA Wily Application Performance Management (APM) achieves this management strategy, ensuring the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board’s mission to sustain accountability and transparency. <a class="external-link" href="http://www.ca.com/Files/Demos/apm_demo.swf">To see the solution in action, click here.</a></p>
<p>When developing, implementing, and maintaining a mission critical web application, important questions to consider are:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How would poor end-user experience affect the success of Recovery.gov and the Recovery and Reinvestment Act?</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Recovery.gov were to become temporarily unavailable, what would be the impact on the American public and how would that affect the perception of the Recovery Board?</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a performance issue arises, will it stall the development process, thus delaying the release of information to the public?</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How long does it take to diagnose the what, where and why of a problem, and is there adequate staff and time available to quickly triage the pending issue?</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">In order to ensure the sustainability and availability of Recovery.gov, it is necessary to monitor, measure, and manage Recovery.gov, a mission critical web application, using the CA Wily APM solution.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is accomplished through the ability to predict problems and monitor all transactions in real-time, 24x7, providing visibility into a complex and typically invisible environment. The visibility that CA Wily APM provides allows the Recovery Board to pinpoint problems proactively, before quality of service is impacted and end-users are affected. When problems do occur, the quick triage and diagnosis will improve productivity within the staff, while increasing the availability and performance of Recovery.gov. The CA Wily APM solution supports the mission of the Recovery Board and assures that accountability and transparency to the public is maintained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The Recovery Board faces a difficult challenge: with tight budgets and limited staff, the Recovery Board must deliver web applications, such as Recovery.gov to their constituents without compromising quality of service or efficiency. Any problems with performance or availability of Recovery.gov could affect the public perception of the Recovery Board.</p>
<p>CA Wily APM products and services allow the Recovery Board to improve citizen satisfaction by monitoring transactions end-to-end, proactively detecting performance issues, and ensuring service level compliance, all in the production environment. The CA solution allows the Recovery Board to focus on delivering pertinent information to the public without having to worry about the performance of the web application, Recovery.gov.</p>

				Bank Regulations for first time Home Buyers
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The actual Bank regulations about home loan should be change to give more opportunity to the people that want buy a house for first time, otherwise the real estate market will be in trouble for long time,&nbsp;The Goverment should&nbsp;requests a detailed inform from the bank about&nbsp;how they&nbsp; expend the 700 billion dollars and push them to create a credit policy that help the american people to start buying their homes. The construction of new houses, schools, roads and business building are going to increase in the same way because the arise of &nbsp;new neirborghoods.</p>
<p>With the present bank's credit policy a working couple that earn around $60,000 can barely cualified for a loan of 250,000 which is the cost average of a house in a working class area.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>it's important because the Real Estate disaster is the origin of actual economy problem</p>

<p>Yes the banking industry should be much more regulated and restricted.&nbsp; Usury rates should be maintained at no more than 10 percent and mortgage rates should be locked at no more than 5 percent.</p>

<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><strong>Use stimulus money to grant new Virtualization, Virtual Desktop Infrastructures, Cloud Computer infrastructures projects<br /><br />Then also use stimulus money to subsidize the infrastructure projects such as:<br /></strong></p>
<ul><li>Virtualize household computers, build home computing infrastructure using common tools.&nbsp; <br /></li>
<ul><li>Purchase of residential bandwidth for telecommunications companies.</li><li>Offset infrastructure costs of extending existing telecommunications services to rural area's<br /></li><li>Acquisition of "Thin compute devices" for home users. <em>which consume less then one tenth of the power standard desktop computers consume.</em><br /></li></ul>
<li>Virtualize power consuming data centers.</li>
<ul><li>Energy credits for utilizing virtualization technology</li><li>Incentives for data center environmental impact reductions.<br /></li></ul>
</ul>
<div><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This idea can be incorporated by households all over the nation.&nbsp; All
classes of citizens could use this technology to reduce household
energy expenses, while ever expanding our information technology
infrastructures.&nbsp; Technology will always be with us, and instead of
having a nation that could be further divided by the "Technology haves"
and the "Technology have <span class="misspell">NOTs</span>"
we should be working to create one technology savvy nation.&nbsp; In 1928
Herbert Hoover had a campaign slogan of "A chicken in every pot and a
car in every garage".&nbsp; We need to modify that slogan for the 21 century
to be "A computer in every house, and energy left to spare"!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;It could be further embraced by all companies small, medium or large
that utilize any form of Information technology services, such as the
standard desktop computer, or web, processing, and data layer
technologies.&nbsp; These are all very common in today's Major power
consuming data centers.&nbsp; <br /><br /></div>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Equality is important.<br />Our Nation is important.<br />The Earth is important.<br /><br />Each
one of these concepts alone are import, but together they are vital.&nbsp;
Everyday I see an increasing gap between the individuals who have, and
the individuals who do not.&nbsp; As time goes on the people involved in
this difference are going to grow up, and that gap will translate to an
even greater technology gap, which will in turn will then magnify to a
economic gap.&nbsp; Utilizing Virtualization technologies is a great way to
reduce carbon emissions caused by using older methods of working on the
Internet.&nbsp; <br /><br /></p>

<h1>
				The New Electronic Reporting System
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I keep hearing the terms “<strong>accountability</strong>” and “<strong>transparency</strong>”
requirements for the <strong>American Recovery and Reinvestment Act </strong>(<strong>ARRA)</strong> and
think that it will be easy to accomplish. Having worked in public
finance for municipal and federal governments, I believe that the
federal side needs to:</p>
<ul><li> <strong><em>understand how local and state finance operates,</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>use the U.S Department of Commerce and U.S. Department of Labor data in assessing know how the demographic and financial environments affect local and state
fiscal conditions,<br /></em></strong> </li><li><strong><em>create an information reporting infrastructure using
XBRL, <br /></em></strong></li><li><strong><em>utilize “</em><em></em><em>Service Efforts and Accomplishments<br /></em> performance
reporting, and </strong></li><li><strong><em>begin to integrate the environmental (demographic and financial
factors) within localities and states utilizing the old tried and true
“Financial Trends Monitoring System” (aka FTMS) introduced by the ICMA
(International Cities/Counties Management Association) several years
ago. </em></strong><br /></li></ul>
The municipal, state, and federal financial technology platforms
(public finance software) must be integrated least we spend more time
“<em>compiling</em>” rather than “<em>assessing and analyzing</em>” all of this disparate data. Why not make
the ARRA information Web 2.0 compatible so that citizens can easily find out
information about <em>ARRA projects</em>, <em>costs</em>, and <em>measurable progress</em>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is missing is “<strong><em>financial information reporting infrastructure”</em></strong>
for combining ARRA local, state and federal <strong>goals</strong>, <strong>objectives</strong>, and
<strong>performance by project</strong> and electronic reporting on the “<strong>status</strong>” of the “<strong>Tasks</strong>” of
these ARRA funded projects on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Citizens want “<strong>context”</strong>. In other words, Recovery.Gov should provide
a citizen with a graphical and tabular view of what “<em><strong>the current
measurable economic and fiscal conditions</strong></em>” are within a community
before ARRA (Recovery Act) a funded project begins (a <strong><em>baseline</em></strong>). I would expect that
some sort of employment, economic activity, and local CPI measurements
would be presented as this “baseline” along with the specific ARRA funded
project GOAL(s), OBJECTIVE(s) matched against each TASK within each
project, and the OUTCOMES of each TASK as well as the entire ARRA
Project. Now the citizen knows where we were before an ARRA funded project began, what is is expected to achieve, and as it will be reported by TASK within each ARRA Funded PROJECT, the citizen would know when a Task is supposed to be accomplished.</p>
<p>With Web 2.0, videos could be embedded to show “progress” by
TASK, a graph of the budget being spent and the RESULTS of the Recovery
Act investment. Have the project manager walk through the Task requirements, what they are doing, and what they have accomplished.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recovery.gov </em></strong>would provide a citizen with information
about “WHAT THE CONDITIONS WERE BEFORE HAND” which formed the basis of
the Project’s “GOALS, OBJECTIVES and PERFORMANCE MEASURES by each TASK’
which will enable the citizen to assess, by the click of a mouse,
whether the project accomplished what it said it would. This is <strong><em>online
transparency </em></strong>and <strong><em>online accountability</em></strong>. With Web 2.0 citizens could ask
questions or gain clarifications about these projects, which would
establish a dialogue with the local, state or federal government
undertaking the project.</p>
<p>Creating a common financial information reporting infrastructure
will also help the auditing and assessment efforts. The use of “<strong>status
reporting</strong>”, similar to “<strong>STAT</strong>” reports (see below) would provide more
sets of eyes to interpret reported results. I am proposing that this
financial information reporting infrastructure follow the outline
below, and that the federal government technology and information
efforts be utilized to implement this reporting using XBRL - enabling
all local and state and federal governments to use XBRL for financial
reporting. XBRL (<strong>eXtensible Business Reporting Language</strong>) is an open
standard that supports information modeling and the expression of
semantic meaning commonly required in financial reporting. XBRL is
XML-based and “tags” financial information to specific organizational
components and financial components. <strong><em>Rather than uploading
spreadsheets, public sector financial systems would report these ARRA
projects through unique XBRL templates</em></strong>.</p>
<p>In the context of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, we
could start with what is currently published on “Recovery.gov” where
the President has identified five “<em>crucial”</em> objectives. I would use
these objectives and offer some REQUIREMENTS to be met for local, state
and federal governments that receive ARRA funding to meet each of the
President’s objectives:</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE 1 - RECOVERY FUNDS ARE AWARDED AND DISTRIBUTED IN A PROMPT, FAIR, AND REASONABLE MANNER; </strong></p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS FOR OBJECTIVE 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.1 LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL PROCUREMENT SYSTEMS MUST USE THE SAME
DATA FIELDS. </strong>Some sort of information technology project to adapt
current state and local government procurement systems to accommodate
the <strong>Central Contractor Registration (CCR)</strong> http://www.ccr.gov/ needs to
happen very quickly so that the “awardees” contractor and subcontractor
can be accounted for between the source (state or local award) and the
federal agency. Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is the primary
registrant database for the U.S. Federal Government. CCR collects,
validates, stores and disseminates data in support of agency
acquisition missions. If you are a business interested in doing
business with the U.S. Federal Government, then you must be registered
in CCR. <strong><em>As ARRA money is federal money going to local and state
governments going to small, medium and large organizations (for profit
and non-profit), what is the strategy for ensuring that they are
registered within the CCR? </em></strong>The public sector financial software
publishers (local, state, and federal financial and procurement
software) must be called in to modify their financial software to accommodate the
entry of this organization information into the CCR. Local and state governments do not use CCR. That is why the confusion for MBE, WBE, and DBE certification at the state and federal levels. And if you think that minority-owned, women-owned, disadvantaged and small business have this problem among states with a laborious certification process, how do you think it will be at a federal level with these business enterprises in several databases? This has to have a solution that will seamlessly integrate all of this information.</p>
<p>It would seem that within public sector accounting systems the
Accounts Payable (AP) and Accounts Receivable (AR) vendor files
utilized for producing IRS Form 1099s is a “measurement focus” that
could be monitored and reported on a monthly basis. This way, IRS Form
1099s related to ARRA funding should be correct as the management and
internal control reviews would be undertaken monthly as payments are
made. It would allow the ability to correct improper payments
(complying with the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 and
Recovery Auditing Act of 2002) by having all ARRA funding recipients
implement enhanced improper payment detection and prevention methods.
This way, local, state and the federal Government can better ensure
that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and efficiently on a monthly
basis using this information as a management control review tool.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL PROCUREMENT SYSTEMS MUST PORTRAY THEIR
RESPECTIVE ACQUISITION PROCESSES.</strong> Not every local and state procurement
process is the same, but we need to agree upon “what” should be
reflected to portray the awarding and distribution of these funds in a
fair and reasonable manner. What would that look like? I would think
that the CCR would reflect the “type” of contractor and subcontractor,
by <strong>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)</strong> code, <strong><em>business
size, types of employment created and/or sustained,</em></strong> and some type of
<strong><em>local or state procurement regulatory compliance metric </em></strong>would be helpful.
Developed in cooperation with Canada and Mexico, the North American
Industry Classification System (NAICS) represents one of the most
profound changes for statistical programs focusing on emerging economic
activities. NAICS, developed using a production-oriented conceptual
framework, groups establishments into industries based on the activity
in which they are primarily engaged. Organizations using similar raw
material inputs, similar capital equipment, and similar labor are
classified in the same industry. Organizations that do similar things
in similar ways are classified together. Classifying and reporting ARRA
information by the “sectors” of the NAICS would enable local, state,
and federal governments, citizens, and auditors to “see” the impact of
stimulus monies through contracts by:</p>
<p><strong>A. GOODS-PRODUCING SECTORS: </strong></p>
<p><strong>NAICS NATURAL RESOURCES AND MINING SECTORS</strong><br />
-	<strong><em>Sector 11 (Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting)<br />
-	Sector 21 (Mining) </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>NAICS CONSTRUCTION SECTOR</strong><br />
-	<strong><em>Sector 23 (Construction)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>NAICS MANUFACTURING SECTOR</strong><br />
-	<strong><em>Sector 31-33 (Manufacturing)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>B. SERVICE-PROVIDING SECTORS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>NAICS TRADE, TRANSPORTATION, AND UTILITIES SECTORS</strong><br />
-<strong><em>	Sector 42 (Wholesale trade)<br />
-	Sector 44-45 (Retail trade)<br />
-	Sector 48-49 (Transportation and warehousing)<br />
-	Sector 22 (Utilities) </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>NAICS INFORMATION SECTOR</strong><br />
-	<strong><em>Sector 51 (Information)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>NAICS FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES SECTORS</strong><br />
-	<strong><em>Sector 52 (Finance and insurance)<br />
-	Sector 53 (Real estate and rental and leasing)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>NAICS PROFESSIONAL AND BUSINESS SERVICES SECTORS<br />
-	<em>Sector 54 (Professional, scientific, and technical services)<br />
-	Sector 55 (Management of companies and enterprises)<br />
-	Sector 56 (Administrative and support and waste management and remediation services) </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>NAICS EDUCATION AND HEALTH SERVICES SECTOR<br />
-	<em>Sector 61 (Education services)<br />
-	Sector 62 (Health care and social assistance) </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>NAICS LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY SECTORS<br />
-	<em>Sector 71 (Arts, entertainment, and recreation)<br />
-	Sector 72 (Accommodation and food services) </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>NAICS OTHER SERVICES SECTOR<br />
-	<em>Sector 81 (Other services, except public administration) </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>NAICS PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SECTOR<br />
-	<em>Sector 92 (Public administration) </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>NAICS UNCLASSIFIED SECTOR<br />
-	<em>Sector 99 (Unclassified)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The public sector financial software publishers must be called in to
modify their software to accommodate the classification of
organizations receiving contracts for ARRA work to utilize NAICS
classification codes</em></strong>. As our economy is composed of different sectors,
reformatting our local, state and federal financial systems to report
on both obligations (encumbrances) by NAICS sector and outlays
(payments) by NAICS sector would provide a quick status report on the
specific “sectors” of our economy that are being stimulated. Note that
the NAICS Sectors presented above are at the highest level, for NAICS
codes have more detail. And the CCR, of course, requires organizations
to register their NAICS code. Since we already have these systems in
place, then why not use them to assess the effectiveness of the ARRA
monies?</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE 2 - THE RECIPIENTS AND USES OF ALL RECOVERY FUNDS ARE
TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC, AND THAT THE PUBLIC BENEFITS OF THESE FUNDS
ARE REPORTED CLEARLY, ACCURATELY, AND IN A TIMELY MANNER; </strong></p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS FOR OBJECTIVE 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1 LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL FINANCIAL SYSTEMS MUST USE THE SAME
DATA FIELDS. </strong>Some sort of information technology project to adapt
current state and local government financial systems to accommodate the:</p>
<p>• The “<strong>General Ledger</strong>” – create an enhanced a <em>cross-walk between the
United States Standard General Ledger (USSGL) and State and Local
government General Ledger GL (Object Class, Cost Element)</em>. Investing in
this change will allow for easier conversion. If all local, state and
federal governments (hint, hint <strong>Federal Accounting Standards Advisory
Board - FASAB </strong>- and <strong>Governmental Accounting Standards Board -GASB</strong>) were
to<strong><em> adopt the utilization of XBRL standards for government financial
reporting</em></strong>, then t<strong><em>he information could be posted along with a monthly
budget status report, project status report, and a report on the status
of a government’s goals, objectives, strategies and performance
measures for the fiscal year</em></strong>. The <strong><em>U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission</em></strong> at the federal level and the <strong><em>State of Oregon</em></strong>  at the state
level has experience utilizing XBRL for financial reporting. The
federal government financial information technology experts could seize
the opportunity of utilizing the SEC’s and State of Oregon’s “<strong><em>best
financial practices</em></strong>” with XBRL to provide local, state and federal
governments with a standardized and automated financial reporting tool.</p>
<p>• The <strong><em>fund type</em></strong> of the recovery funding will inform the citizen
where the federal money will reside and the accounting and budgeting
rules the respective state or local government utilizes to disburse
payments. There are reporting and usage rules regarding the different
types of funds – similar to the bank accounts that local, state and
federal governments post the recovery act monies. One of the golden
rules of budgeting that may be broken is that of “one-time revenues
going to one-time expenditures”. <strong><em>Capital projects utilizing recovery
act funding should disclose the fixed asset valuation before the
recovery act funds are used, and after the recovery act funds are used.
Annual maintenance costs should be disclosed for every capital project
utilizing recovery act funds.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>2.2 STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FINANCIAL SYSTEMS MUST BE ABLE TO
INCORPORATE THE RECOVERY ACT PROJECT GOAL, OBJECTIVE, STRATEGY AND
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT INTO THEIR ACCOUNTING STRUCTURE.</strong> State and
local government recovery reports must be designed to enable
management, stakeholders, citizens, and employees to assess Recovery
Act funded programs and financial performance as compared to its goals,
objectives, strategies and performance measures and to use this
information to make necessary assessments and improvements. I would
envision that some sort of presentation of the following would be
portrayed:</p>
<p>• <em><strong>Recovery Act Project Name<br />
• Recovery Act Project Goal<br />
• Fund<br />
• Contract Number<br />
• Awardee(s)<br />
• Budget by:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  * Object Class<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  * Encumbrance (Obligations)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  *Outlay (tie the outlay to jobs created or&nbsp; retained)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  *Remaining Balance</strong></em></p>
<p>• <strong><em>Recovery Project Plan by Tasks with:<br />
- Task Begin Date,<br />
- Task End Date,<br />
- Task Outcome/Deliverable,<br />
- Task Cost, and<br />
- Task Status</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Local, state and federal government management would monitor and
manage <strong><em>underperforming Tasks</em></strong> before the project fails. We would let the
public “see” the status of all Tasks in all projects.</p>
<p>• <strong>Performance Measures</strong>: Use the GASB’s Service Efforts and Accomplishments (SEA) Model to keep it consistent:</p>
<p>– <strong>Inputs</strong> (like the number of teachers, or tons of asphalt used to repair roads);</p>
<p>- <strong>Outputs </strong>(such as the number of students promoted, or the number of potholes filled);</p>
<p>- <strong>Outcomes</strong> (for instance, percentage of a high school’s students entering college, or the physical condition rating of roads);</p>
<p>- <strong>Efficiency </strong>(cost per pupil educated, or cost per pothole filled); and</p>
<p>- <strong>Effectiveness </strong>(attainment of stated goals and measurable objectives).</p>
<p>Use a simple “green”, “yellow” and “red” coding to assess “where”
planned performance is at. Do not wait until the fiscal year ends in
order to assess performance, assess performance on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>•<strong> Jobs Created, By EEO-1 Job Classification Category –</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Jobs Retained, By EEO-1 Job Classification Category –</strong></p>
<p>The nine EEO-1 job classification categories include 1) Officials
and Managers, 2) Professionals, 3) Technicians, 4) Sales Workers, 5)
Office and Clerical Workers, 6) Craft Workers (skilled), 7) Operatives
(semiskilled), Laborers (unskilled), and 9) Service Workers.</p>
<p>Is it not practical to report on jobs created or jobs retained based
on these existing categories to allow the public and decision makers to
assess the impact of recovery act monies?</p>
<p>Would it also be more practical to post the EEO-1 job goals against
the actual jobs created or retained to see if these goals were met?</p>
<p>As a refresher, here are the job descriptions of each classification category:</p>
<p>1. “<strong>Officials and Managers</strong>” includes jobs that require policymaking
and overseeing responsibility. Examples are: executives, middle
management, and salaried supervisors.</p>
<p>2. “<strong>Professionals”</strong> includes jobs that require college education or
comparable experience. Examples are: accountants, architects,
librarians, and teachers.</p>
<p>3. “<strong>Technicians”</strong> includes jobs that combine basic scientific
knowledge, usually obtained through two years of post-secondary
education, and manual skill. Examples are: computer programmers, junior
engineers, and photographers.</p>
<p>4. “<strong>Sales Workers</strong>” includes jobs that primarily involve selling.  Examples are: real estate agents and sales clerks.</p>
<p>5. “<strong>Office and Clerical</strong>” includes clerical, non-manual work.  Examples are: bookkeepers and office helpers.</p>
<p>6. “<strong>Craft Workers</strong>” includes manual work that requires comprehensive
knowledge of work processes. Examples are: building trade positions,
mechanics, tailors, and bakers.</p>
<p>7. “<strong>Operatives</strong>” includes factory-types duties that require an
intermediate skill level with limited training. Examples are:
chauffeurs, laundry and dry cleaning operatives, welders, and
inspectors.</p>
<p>8. “<strong>Laborers”</strong> includes manual work with no special training.  Examples are: garage laborers and gardeners.</p>
<p>9. “<strong>Service Workers”</strong> includes jobs in protective and non-protective
service occupations. Examples are: barbers, firefighters, door keepers,
police officers, waiters, and guides.</p>
<p><strong><em>Local, State and federal agencies need to automate the EEO-1 Job
Category reporting system (i.e., through payroll tax reporting and
benefits paid by recovery act monies) to ensure that the jobs were real
and payments to employees were made</em></strong>. Again, the federal government
financial information technology experts have an opportunity for
developing standards for “payroll system” architectures for
organizations who “employ” workers with ARRA monies by the EEO-1
Category and by NAICS code. Now that it transparency - by “sector” and
by “job classification”. The audit community would have the opportunity
to validate and verify this information on a monthly basis.</p>
<p><strong>FINANCIAL TREND MONITORING SYSTEM (FTMS) METRICS </strong>{see below}</p>
<p>When an <strong>OUTLAY </strong>is made against <strong>Non-Personal Services (NPS</strong>) in the
form of a <strong>PURCHASE ORDER </strong>and/or a <strong>Personal Services (PS)</strong> salary and
benefit payment, it would be reported “when it happens”. A discussion
with all of the public sector financial system software publishers
would be necessary to make this reporting consistent in all of the
systems. I propose all of the systems being modified to accommodate
this.<br /></p>
<p>Note that <strong><em>State Employment Security Offices</em></strong> would be involved to assess
the localities' EEO-1 Job Classification Categories. <strong><em>The local and state issuers of
business licenses, who should also be required to utilize the CCR,
would be brought in to assess whether or not they were licensed.</em></strong> The
local and state finance offices would be involved in<strong> examining revenues
as a result of their local firms being involved in Recovery Act funded
projects</strong>.</p>
<p>If one thinks about it, local, state and federal government jobs
(Personal Services) or contracts for products or services (Non Personal
Services) should have all ARRA outlays (payments) also linked to a
NAICS sector and/or EEO-1 Job Classification. This way, there would be
a linkage and alignment in assessing the number of teachers or public
works staff being financed through ARRA money “when payments are
actually made”. Rather than waiting to the end of the project or fiscal
year, citizens and auditors could examine and assess the relationship
between the Input (money), Process (job or task or project being
undertaken) and Output being undertaken.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE 3 - RECOVERY FUNDS ARE USED FOR AUTHORIZED PURPOSES AND
EVERY STEP IS TAKEN TO PREVENT INSTANCES OF FRAUD, WASTE, ERROR, AND
ABUSE; </strong></p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS FOR OBJECTIVE 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1 LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL MANAGERS NEED TO ESTABLISH MANAGEMENT
CONTROL REVIEW SYSTEMS. </strong>Some sort of consortium with professional
organizations (elected officials, state and city and county management,
the audit community, state and city and county financial management,
state and city and county technology management, state and city and
county economic development, and state and city and county procurement
management) should be used to develop and distribute some <strong>Management
Control Review (MCR) </strong>policies and procedures to utilize. The purpose of
a Management Control Review (MCR) is to evaluate the management
controls of a specific activity and determine how well they promote
good management. Additionally, the reviews will help local, state and
federal governments utilize their ARRA monies more efficiently and
effectively, and to provide a reasonable level of assurance that the
process and products for which the local or state or federal agency is
responsible is adequately protected. Rather than reinvent the wheel,
utilizing a generic Management Control Review (MCR) policy and
procedure that could be adapted to the specific environment could be
undertaken by existing professional organizations and made accessible
on the web to prevent instances of fraud, waste, error and abuse. The
typical steps of Management Control Review consists of:</p>
<p><strong><em>1) Conducting a Risk Assessment,<br />
2) Reviewing Internal Controls,<br />
3) Report Findings, and<br />
4) Monitoring.</em></strong></p>
<p>Why not develop an MCR policy and procedure incorporating these four
steps now, automating them through a web based system (with the help of
the federal financial information systems experts) to enable these
“checks” and “balances” to be disclosed in “real-time”?</p>
<p><strong>3.2 UTILIZE LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL AUDITORS</strong>. With the above
systems already in place, the careful eye, expertise, and audits of our
auditor community would be required. In light of the financial audits
that every local, state and federal governmental entity must do, the
audit community must weigh in on the timing and initiation of the
Recovery Act audits. This raises some questions that need to be
addressed:</p>
<ul><li><strong><em>How does OMB desire local, state and federal governments to audit their ARRA funded projects? </em></strong></li></ul>
<ul><li><strong><em>Can local, state and federal governments use a portion of the ARRA
monies to have their external auditors perform an audit that is
separate or part of the OMB Circular A-133 (Audits of States, Local
Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations)?</em></strong></li></ul>
<ul><li><strong><em>What should the specific roles of Inspector Generals at the federal
level or audit officials at the local, state and federal levels be
regarding:</em></strong></li></ul>
<ul><li>Making independent audits and investigations of their agencies’
programs, operations, activities, and functions that are ARRA funded?</li></ul>
<ul><li>Overseeing the work of non-Federal auditors performed in connection with Federal ARRA funded programs?</li></ul>
<ul><li>Reviewing responses to ARRA related audit reports and reporting
significant disagreements to the ARRA related audit followup official? </li></ul>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE 4 - PROJECTS FUNDED UNDER THE RECOVERY LEGISLATION AVOID UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND COST OVERRUNS; </strong></p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS FOR OBJECTIVE 4:</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.1 LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL MANAGERS NEED TO UTILIZE REPORTING
SYSTEMS LIKE THAT SUGGESTED IN 2.2 ABOVE TO QUICKLY INTERVENING TO
AVOID UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND COST OVERRUNS. </strong>Early intervention by
managing projects and examining their status within their financial
systems could be performed by conducting weekly (yes, weekly) status
reports that are transmitted to Recovery dot com along with any
remediation plans. With the advent of XBRL, it is time to have the
FASAB and GASB oversee the development of the reporting of governmental
budget, financial, performance, and project information on a monthly
basis and eventually in real-time. The stimulus money could go far in
investing in a project with the FASAB and GASB in automating monthly
local, state and federal government reporting of financial, project,
and performance results (unaudited) and at the end of the fiscal year
post the audited results online. Take the guessing out of it. Use the
technology and put accountability on line.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 REVIEW AND/OR APPROVAL BY FEDERAL AGENCIES OF LOCAL, STATE AND
FEDERAL REMEDIATION PLANS MUST BE AUTOMATED.</strong> The success of the Obama
campaign using new media and participatory democracy techniques has set
high expectations for those same techniques being used in actual
governing. I think the principles and practices of Web 2.0 can help
bring increased ARRA transparency, public involvement and reduced cost
to government. <strong><em>How will the federal, state and local technology experts
integrate the aforementioned as a mechanism to quickly inform
management and to make a decision to take remedial action?</em></strong> Web 2.0 must
be used to help local, state and federal government ARRA projects
easily report on their status, communicate issues and challenges, and
collaborate with federal officials in resolving issues and challenges.
I would imagine that a web-based form on Recovery.gov where a local,
state or federal agency completes the information on an ARRA funded
project could make decision-making more “fact-based”. Remember,
however, that unlike program and service Web 2.0 transactions,
government financial transactions and reporting requires additional
internal controls. <strong><em>Perhaps the Federal Systems Integration Office
(FSIO) could develop some “ARRA Web 2.0 reporting standards” for local,
state and federal governments to utilize. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE 5 - PROGRAMS MEET SPECIFIC GOALS AND TARGETS, AND CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED PERFORMANCE ON BROAD ECONOMIC INDICATORS. </strong></p>
<p><strong>5.1 LOCALITIES AND STATES SHOULD USE THE FINANCIAL TRENDS MONITORING
SYSTEM AS A COMPONENT OF THEIR PERFORMANCE REPORTING. </strong>The <strong><em>Financial
Trend Monitoring System (FTMS), </em></strong>adapted from the system developed by
the <strong><em>International City/County Management Association (ICMA)</em></strong>,
“identifies the factors that affect financial condition and arranges
them in a rational order so that they can be more easily analyzed and
measured.”</p>
<p><strong>5.2. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.2.1 COMMUNITY NEEDS AND RESOURCES</strong></p>
<p>• <strong><em>Population<br />
• Density<br />
• Age<br />
• Income<br />
• Property value distribution<br />
• Home ownership<br />
• Vacancy rates<br />
• Crime rate<br />
• Employment<br />
• Business activit</em></strong>y</p>
<p>The local, state and federal governments need to know what were the
community needs and available resources based on the indicators above
“before” and “after” the Recovery Act investments. Community needs and
resources influences the demand for services as well as the capacity to
generate revenues to fund these services. Add to this the cause and
effect relationship of the financing of projects for medical care,
transportation, education and green technology and citizens would have
a clearer view of “what it is” we are trying to accomplish and “what
the anticipated effect’ we expect these projects to have on the
variables cited above. I would expect that ARRA projects would address
their anticipated impact on anticipated trends of population, density,
age, income, property value distribution, home ownership, vacancy
rates, crime rate, employment and business activity in the community.</p>
<p><strong>5.2.2 INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS</strong></p>
<p>• <strong><em>Intergovernmental mandates<br />
• Tax restrictions</em></strong></p>
<p>The local, state and federal governments need to identify what were
the intergovernmental constraints based on the indicators above
“before” and “after” the Recovery Act investments.</p>
<ul><li><strong><em>Are there any lessons learned or were laws, rules and regulations streamlined as a result of these ARRA investments? </em></strong></li></ul>
<ul><li><strong><em>Will Recovery.gov track any new legislation at the local or state or
federal level that must be modified in order to achieve a ARRA project
goal or objective?</em></strong></li></ul>
<p>These are a few value-added measurements that could make Recovery.Gov more informative.</p>
<p><strong>5.2.3 DISASTER RISK</strong></p>
<p><strong>• <em>Potential for natural disaster<br />
• Local preparedness</em></strong></p>
<p>Local, state and federal government need to assess their disaster
risk before they received the Recovery Act investment and determine
whether they were addressed as a result of receiving these monies. Mind
you, if there is a natural disaster in a town, borough, neighborhood,
city or county, then they are going to see whether local preparedness
was addressed by local and state and federal emergency management
agencies to be funded by ARRA monies.</p>
<p><strong>5.2.4 POLITICAL CULTURE</strong></p>
<p>• <strong><em>Attitudes toward taxes, services and political processes</em></strong></p>
<p>Local, state and federal governments have a once in a lifetime
opportunity to assess the public’s attitudes as to whether these
projects were efficiently implemented, effectively met their
performance measures, and whether attitudes about government have
changed. Feedback is needed.</p>
<p><strong>5.2.5 EXTERNAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</strong></p>
<p>• <strong><em>National &amp; regional:<br />
  o Inflation<br />
  o Employment<br />
  o Market changes</em></strong></p>
<p>Local, state and federal governments need to tailor the economic
analysis of specific areas and uses the <strong>NAICS </strong>data to assess expansion
or contraction by sector of the <strong><em>local </em><em>e</em><em>conomy, local disposable income, local housing,</em></strong>
and <strong><em>local employment</em></strong>. The federal government should work closer with local
and state governments in assessing the components of the local <strong><em>Consumer
Price Index (CPI) </em></strong>as a part of community and economic development
initiatives. Measurements of the impact of other federal aid (from the SBA, EDA,
MBDA, etc) should also be shared with local and state officials and linked to the FTMS model of the locality to assess any cause and effect relationships. The
federal, state and local governments should post this on a <strong><em>Geographic
Information System (GIS) </em></strong>so that the public can see where we are based
on empirical data.</p>
<p><em>I would expect that a database of organizations (public, private or non-profit by NAICS code) that undertook ARRA
related projects that created or retained jobs within a locality would
be posted on Recovery.gov</em>. As the CPI may be influenced by
uncontrollable variables (trends of population, density, age, income,
property value distribution, home ownership, vacancy rates, crime rate,
employment and business activity) in the community, that could be
empirically shown on the website. Working with the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) and the colleges and universities that report CPI
data, as well as the local and state economic development, housing,
criminal justice, health care, transportation and education agencies to
provide their assessment would make this invaluable.</p>
<p><strong>5.3. FINANCIAL FACTORS</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.3.1 REVENUES</strong></p>
<p>• <strong><em>Growth<br />
• Flexibility<br />
• Elasticity<br />
• Dependability<br />
• Diversity<br />
• Administration</em></strong></p>
<p>Local and state governments need to carefully assess their <strong><em>revenue
streams now and in the future</em></strong>. After all, investments in Going Green,
transportation, education, automated health records, job training,
affordable housing, and other areas need to assess <strong><em>when the return on
the investments will occur</em></strong>, and <strong><em>how much it will impact the future
government revenue stream</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>5.3.2 EXPENDITURES</strong></p>
<p>• <em>Growth Priorities<br />
• Productivity<br />
• Effectiveness<br />
• Mandated costs</em></p>
<p>Local and state governments must utilize their <strong><em>comprehensive plans
</em></strong>and <em><strong>GIS </strong></em>to project growth. From these projections, plans must be
developed which take into account the <em>cost of implementing</em>, the <em>cost of
no growth</em>, and the <em>cost of a decline in growth</em>. This will have an
impact on the future role of local and state government.</p>
<p>I am
envisioning the development of a “<strong>Stats</strong>” systems, where
program/division/department/agency heads and representatives meet
regularly with executive officials to discuss performance data and
develop strategies to improve or sustain the performance of each
participating program/division/department/agency. Meetings would enable
program/division/department/agency heads, staff, and executive
officials to review and analyze measurements of
program/division/department/agency performance and efficiency. A <strong><em>stats
system</em></strong> would be developed on Recovery.gov based on the idea of holding
program/division anddepartment/agency directors responsible for ARRA
project results through a regular review of performance data. <strong><em>If any
ARRA funded programs or services were not performing as expected, then
strategies would then be developed to quickly correct any problems.</em></strong>
Because a stats system relies on real-time access to operational level
data, and resources to develop strategies to quickly correct problems,
it requires an investment in technology and commitment from executives.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stats systems </em></strong>at times would be viewed as confrontational as
program/division/department/agency directors would be “<em>put on the spot”</em>
for poor performance. This however, is not their intent. The purpose of
a <strong><em>stats program</em></strong> is to f<strong><em>ocus decision makers attention on operational
level data to identify and correct unwanted trends before they become
big problems.</em></strong> <strong><em>ARRA Stats systems</em></strong> would be most effective when
operational reviews were connected with achievement of defined ARRA
funded project goals and objectives.</p>
<p><strong>5.3.3 OPERATING POSITION</strong></p>
<p>• <em><strong>Operating results<br />
• Fund balances<br />
• Reserves<br />
• Liquidity</strong></em></p>
<p>Local and state governments must assess the impact of the Recovery
Act investments on their <strong><em>respective operating results, fund balances,
reserves</em></strong>, and <strong><em>liquidity</em></strong>. Local and state government financial policies
and financial plans must run some scenarios on these measures from
which to base decisions upon and to discuss with citizens, taxpayers,
ratepayers and bondholders. <strong><em>Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch
Financial</em></strong> utilize similar financial metrics to assess credit
worthiness. <strong><em>If ARRA monies have a direct impact on a local or state
government’s credit worthiness, then why do we not model and report on
it on Recovery.gov on a monthly basis?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>5.3.4 DEBT STRUCTURE</strong></p>
<p>• <strong><em>Pension obligations<br />
• Pension assets<br />
• Post employee benefits</em></strong></p>
<p>Local and state governments adherence to <strong>GASB Statement 50 </strong>that
amended GASB Statements No. 25, Financial Reporting for Defined Benefit
Pension Plans and Note Disclosures for Defined Contribution Plans, and
No. 27, Accounting for Pensions by State and Local Governmental
Employers, by requiring:</p>
<ul><li>Disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of pension plans
and certain employer local and state governments of the current funded
status of the plan—in other words, the degree to which the actuarial
accrued liabilities for benefits are covered by assets that have been
set aside to pay the benefits—as of the most recent actuarial valuation
date.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Local and state governments that use the aggregate actuarial cost
method to disclose the funded status and present a multi-year schedule
of funding progress using the entry age actuarial cost method as a
surrogate; these governments previously were not required to provide
this information.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Disclosure by local and state governments participating in
multi-employer cost-sharing pension plans of how the contractually
required contribution rate is determined.</li></ul>
<p>The status of local and state governments fiscal capacity to <strong><em>meet these obligations</em></strong>
must be disclosed to citizens along with the fiscal impact on the cost
of future government service. Citizens will probably ask whether the
federal government is fully disclosing the future cost of federal
pension liabilities on its financial statements. This is an issue that
cannot be swept under the rug.</p>
<p><strong>5.3.5 CONDITION OF CAPITAL PLANT</strong></p>
<p><strong>• <em>Maintenance of effort<br />
• Capital outlay</em></strong></p>
<p>The <strong><em>useful life of capital assets</em></strong> needs to be carefully examined at
the local, state and federal level. <strong><em>Citizens will want to know whether
we are underfunding capital asset maintenance within our current
operating budgets</em></strong>. Perhaps now is the time for local, state and federal
governments to enhance the budget descriptions of capital asset
maintenance that is funded in the operating budgets in terms of its
expected impact on the capital assets useful life. As the commercial
says, “you can pay me now or you can pay me later”. It would be
extremely is unfortunate if the bulk of these Recovery Act investments
did not go for bringing lagging capital asset conditions to a locality
or state or federal government’s published asset condition standard.
Does your government have capital asset condition standards in its
annual capital and fixed asset inventory?</p>
<p>If these tools were used and implemented in a standardized manner
then it could be used to pull together the pertinent information from
the local or state government’s budgetary and financial reports, mix it
with the appropriate economic and demographic data, and creates a
series of local government financial indicators that, when plotted over
a period of time, can be used to monitor changes in financial condition
as a result of receiving Recovery Act money.</p>
Note that the <strong><em>financial indicators</em></strong>
<p> include such things as:</p>
<ul><li>cash
liquidity, <br /></li><li>level of business activities, <br /></li><li>changes in fund balance, and <br /></li><li>external revenue dependencies. </li></ul>
The FTMS can also assist the elected
officials in a<strong><em>ssessing how the recovery act monies affect their
long-range policy priorities</em></strong> and can provide a <strong><em>logical way of
introducing long-range considerations into the annual budget process</em></strong>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Using web based technology for financial, performance and project reporting as
well as audited financial statements utilizing XBRL on internet would
create accountability. Local, state, and federal government financial information ought to be XBRL based to enable citizens to view and assess it, There are a lot of government finance officers who question the effectiveness of preparaing a <strong><em>Performance Accountability Report (PAR)</em></strong> at the federal level or a <strong><em>Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR)</em></strong>
<p> at the local or state level - Web 2.0 dialogue and feedback from citizens would enhance the discussion. Perhaps partnering with high schools, colleges and universities in developing courses in how to read and understand a PAR or a CAFR would give government the feedback it so desparately deserves (not to mention inform our citizens what this information really tells you).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Mapping these projects on a <em><strong>Geographical
Information System</strong></em>
<p> (GIS) along with the project status would create millions
of eyes on the prize. Can you imagine how mapping unemployment data by a locality would affect the selection of one of these ARRA funded projects - before the project began, and after it was completed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have listened to all of the “planning” and “integration”
discussions about the implementation, reporting and monitoring of the
ARRA from a conceptual level. I offer some implementation details at
the logical level that would help the local, state and federal
financial information systems experts create an “data architecture” at
the physical level and fund the modification of existing financial and
procurement systems to collect and report ARRA information through a
<em><strong>Web 2.0</strong></em> approach. The shift will be from the federal government's service-oriented architecture (SOA) to Web-oriented architecture (WOA).</p>
<p>If you have had the opportunity to listen to NPR “<strong><em>All
Things Considered</em></strong>” program called <strong>REMAKING MICHIGAN, RETOOLING DETROIT</strong>,
then I think that you would see how utilizing my recommendations would help
citizens monitor and track progress that the State of Michigan is
undertaking to restructure its economic base and how Detroit is
retooling its business base. For those of you who read the
<strong><em>Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports</em></strong> (called <strong><em>CAFRs</em></strong>) of local and
state governments, you know that CAFRs contain a required statistical section of the “<strong><em>Top
Taxpayers</em></strong>” and the “<strong><em>Top Employers</em></strong>” of a city, town, county, state or other governmental entity (school, college, university, public utility district, special taxing district, public transportation agency, stadium authority, ect.). If local and state governments were
to report this information by NAICS codes (sectors of their local economy) and compare the changes in the NAICS composition of these
sectors for the past 10 to 15 years, then it would indeed show how the
economic sectors have been changing (like what has happened in Michigan and its localities). Here again, state and local government has this
information and must use it more strategically. If the financial information infrastructure could be developed to caputure this information every fiscal year, then policy would indeed become "fact-based" rather than "intuition-based". The federal government could also examine this information and enhance it with Bureau of Labor Staistics reports and other economic data.</p>
<ul><li>What is the impact that
these ARRA funded projects expected to have on the FY 2009 and FY 2010
"<strong><em>Top Taxpayers</em></strong>” and the “<strong><em>T</em><em>op Employers</em></strong>” of local and state governments
that prepare CAFRs? Again, if the federal government better understood local and state finance, then they would know why this is related.<br /></li></ul>
<p><strong><em>Why re-invent the wheel? </em></strong>Make a decision on the tools, collaborate
with professional organizations and financial/procurement public sector
software publishers, automate the reporting, and accountability and
transparency awaits. These are actions that the federal government needs to lead,
and for some aspects, invest in technology and enhanced reporting to
make it accessible. But unless you have local and state financial people involved, it is not going to work. For example, most of these "planning sessions" for the ARRA are with federal agencies and federal finance people while the people who deliver the service, account for it in their financial systems, and report its results are the local and state finance officers. And what is the federal government providing them?</p>
<p>It is that simple. “Just Do It”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>There seems to be a "federal perspective" bias about the ARRA. This idea supports the local and state perspectives as we are not at the table, we have to have balanced budgets, we have to modify local or state legislation, our accounting systems operate under GASB pronouncments and not FASAB pronouncnements (which the feds do not understand), and our financial information system architecture requires some significant modifications.</p>

<h1>
				Use Community-Sized Buckets of Money
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>One observation I've had in 44 years of citizenship is that the government tends to engage in grand visions with equally grand buckets of money that seem to get locked under the control of a small number of stakeholders. When a billion dollars is thrown around for a good-works venture here, and a hopeful-initiative there, it's too easy for a million here and $10 million there to be squandered. Inevitably, too many layers of management are put into place, with far too many people with bureaucratic mindsets. Factor in consultants, lobbyists, 'training off-sites', meetings, planning studies, and before you know it, the power of $1 billion to do any good has been whittled down to $100 million or less.</p>
<p>My broad suggestion is for the government to look for ways to break up the stimulus money into small buckets, and put these buckets on the front lines of the economic crisis: communities. Get some visionary people who aren't afraid to take risks, who don't care about making GS-15 or SES, who aren't waiting out their next performance report hoping for another 4% raise. Put them in charge. Have them seek out good ideas on small scales in tightly focused areas.</p>
<p>In fact, I have my own idea for creating a lot of value at the neighborhood level. I own a bunch of rental houses in a low income area, and the kids there are always pestering me to borrow tools to fix things, do yardwork, etc. These kids are too poor to have lawnmowerd, weed whackers, hedge clippers, but if they did, they'd fan out for two miles in each direction grooming the heck out of Manassas, Virginia. I'm working with the City to get a nominal amount of money to do micro-loans to get these kids some used yard tools they can use to make money. But I'd love to see it expand beyond that. How about a neighborhood program for tool rentals, teaching home maintenance, basic home repair, lightweight skills that are ALWAYS needed, and skills that could lead to other opportunities. I'm looking for $1000.00. Yup. I could leverage the heck out of $1000.00. So could one million other entrepreneurially minded community "spark plugs". Total cost: $1 billion. I believe it would be easier to manage how and where the money is spent if the buckets are kept small, the oversight light, and the financial reporting simple.</p>

<p>The nice thing about this idea is it's something that could only be done with today's cheap and ubiquitous technology. An example of a site that does this for other countries is http://kiva.org and I see no reason why these billions can't be distributed in smaller, more-efficient projects like the kind funded by such a website.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>A lot of the best ideas, tools, and approaches regarding the use of recovery funds are being developed by 3rd party developers and thought leaders like Stimuluswatch.org.</p>
<p>Rather than re-create these sites, the government should create a directory on recovery.gov of these sites (or at least the top sites)</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>An easy way to leverage the brilliant minds outside the government already working hard to monitor the expenses and use of recovery funds.</p>

Yes, our beloved President was all about coal while running for the office and finding ways to make for clean coal, but that is not possiale in his 4 yr run...but cap and trade is and with his Buddy at GE, they will have years of millions of money to make together. So no matter if he gets relected again, he gets the Pot-O-Gold$$$.</p>

				Comprehensive Security Approach
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The government&nbsp;should consider key trusted security advisor and security partner/s in monitoring expenditures and using recovery funds.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The government must consider the likelihood of piracy and theft of both direct capital as well as information capital as it carries out its recovery tasking.&nbsp; All levels of security must be accounted for and employed including Governance and Compliance at a high-level as well as securing People and Identity, Data and Information, Applications and Processes, Networks Servers and Endpoints, and most certainly Physical Infrastructure.&nbsp; While the government does indeed have home-grown capability in each area, it can certainly benefit from corporate knowledge, strategies and products&nbsp;both for best-practices as well as cost-saving security tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critical to leveraging the corporate arena will be finding actual corporations that provide best-of-breed products and services and resources that have both a strong R&amp;D backbone as well as real-world implementation in ideally a global setting.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two must co-exist for effective&nbsp;continual security as the world of cyber-crime and cyber-terrorism methodologies&nbsp;is in constant flux.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So which companies exist that provide such comprehensive security?&nbsp; There really is no actual silver bullet as being able to completely overhaul existing security infrastructure is cost-prohibitive.&nbsp; However, being able to leverage a corporation with deep security knowledge, frameworks to integrate security tools that are cross-vendor rather than&nbsp;straight rip-and-replace, as well as significant incumbency and experience does fortunately exist.&nbsp; IBM immediately comes to mind as a clear-cut leader.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the law reads right now the child tax credit and additional child tax credit and additional child tqax credit&nbsp;can be used by people who do not have a social security number.&nbsp; In fact they are not citizens of the US.&nbsp; The law needs to be changed that says only people and children under 17 that have a valid Social Security Number are eligible for this credit.&nbsp; This credit should be for <u>US citizens and permanent legal residents&nbsp;only.</u></p>

<p>This will save millions of dollars in taxes.&nbsp; right now people who have individual taxpayer identifying numbers and have children under 17 qualify.&nbsp; The illegal workers in most instances never pay a dime in taxes and they get thousands of dollars in refunds. This needs to be changed.&nbsp; The number&nbsp;people being claimed as Mexican dependents by illegal residents is unbelievable.&nbsp; With the savings this would bring you could increase the age of the qualifying child to 21 if claimed as a dependent which would help out the ordinary citizen.&nbsp; You would still save millions of dollars.</p>

 <div id="question">
<h1>
				the need for standards
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>From a data management perspective, we
can only roughly gauge transparency by what gets reported.  What the
administration stands to gain in terms of control over recipient
organizations will actually drive specific reporting requirements. 
Let’s suppose that seeing every disbursement hierarchically
organized by project, recipient organization, etc. along with the
payout timeframes, amounts, end recipients – literal and
represented, end recipient billing location – both physical and by
congressional district, stated purpose and so forth may merely
represent the basics.  The end results may not suffice, so some
insights into the spending process should also be reported.  For
example, reporting should include planned and actual milestones,
amounts and timeframes on a periodic basis.  For the sake of
consistency as well as cutting off an avenue to “revise” history,
only actuals would undergo correction.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Some of the other usual technical
standards would apply as well.  A data dictionary and glossary of
terms would complement the report specifications.  Reporting would
occur at regular intervals in response to the release of funds.  The
most meaningful consequence of all this is that the reporting schema
would be exactly what its existence implies, an absolute standard.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even if a standard were adopted,
separate recipients may already have their own reporting methods.  In
such cases, the transparency initiative’s standard should at least
form a portion of each recipient’s overall specification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over time, basic reporting
specification should comprise an increasing proportion of an
recipient’s overall reporting specification.  This change should
occur not only because recipients might choose to increasingly align
their reporting with the standard, but also because the
administration begins to integrate the diverse elements from the
organizations’ standards into the standard.  Conceivably, the
administration could treat the relative growth of the basic reporting
specification as a proportion of the recipients’ reporting
specifications as a sign of increasing transparency.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Imposing a basic reporting standard has
the added benefit of making data amenable to ETL operations to in
turn support data mining.  It provides an instrument for future
planning.</p>
<p>Conversely, data mining provides a
mechanism to detect disembling in the reported data.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Assuming that the very process of
imposing a standard will invite pushback even serves a purpose. 
Further investigation on each pushback has the potential to reveal
accounting deficiencies.  In the best case, this results in some sort
of process improvement to facilitate transparency.  In the worst
case, the administration removes an obstacle to transparency.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest strength of the
reporting standard is that it can facilitate the release of data to
the general public.  The reported data could be made available
through any number of existing feed technologies, such as RSS. 
Public feedback on data quality will provide input for further
improving reporting standards and transparency.</p>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The transparency initiative referenced
at recovery.gov inevitably provokes some critical questions.  How
will its mechanics promote and achieve transparency.  Can
“transparency progress” be measured or tracked?  If so, then how?
 What does the presidential administration want to gain with the
initiative – in the specific terms discussed behind closed doors,
not necessarily the terms placed on a public website?  Most
importantly, what defines transparency?  These days, IT has an
obvious role in the transparency initiative.  It will play a key role
in passing and presenting data.  A deeper consideration of IT’s
role, however, delves into the mindset governing its employment and
evolution</p>

				Citizen Feedback
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">If the goal is truly to allow the monitoring of expenditures and use of funds, then the first issue which should be addressed is the effectiveness of the data you capture.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a class="external-link" href="http://www.neighborhoodamerica.com/reveal">REVEAL</a>, and the rest of the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.neighborhoodamerica.com">Neighborhood America</a> offering, is built on the <a class="external-link" href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;technology stack.&nbsp; It enables organizations to invite their constituents to not only share new ideas, but also help determine which ones are the best.&nbsp; REVEAL is ideally suited for government entities that seek new ideas for innovation.&nbsp; Through an online community offering ratings and rankings, members are empowered to bring the best ideas to the top, so that decision-makers can focus on those ideas that show the most potential for success - eliminating the time-consuming task of filtering through volumes of suggestions to determine which are useful.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">The following ideas are all included as core components of <a class="external-link" href="http://www.neighborhoodamerica.com/reveal">Neighborhood America's REVEAL</a> solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><strong>Structure</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Collecting ideas is only part of the equation. 10,000 ideas collected on change.gov showed people were willing to participate – but it also showed an inability to manage the data or present it in a useful format to either the citizens or the agency trying to listen to the feedback. The content was daunting and disorganized.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><strong>Visual content</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Governments may be accustomed to text-heavy reports, but citizens are not. Exchanges that rely solely on text oftentimes are not compelling enough to capture attention or inspire involvement. Visually stimulating data is always more relevant and appealing to the average citizen.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><strong>Transparency vs. Moderation</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Transparency is great, but moderation is a must. The same rules and checkpoints that are used in a traditional town hall meeting must be applied to the Web. Wouldn’t the government ensure that a special interest group could not hijack the conversation at a town hall meeting – and have a plan of action in place that would have that person removed immediately? Yet that wasn’t the case when special interest groups flooded WhiteHouse.gov and pushed their agenda for legalizing marijuana to the top of the ‘best ideas’ pool. The activity immediately damaged credibility – among citizens and the media - for what the White House was trying to accomplish.</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><strong>Management Efficiencies</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing">A trademark of the Obama administration is a renewed focus on transparency, collaboration and citizen involvement. The need to deploy multiple social media initiatives will exponentially grow over the coming years. How will you manage it all? To support this in the most efficient manner, you must be able to efficiently manage all of the citizen data – even across multiple agencies - from a single portal to ensure consistency and ease of administration, analytics and reporting.</p>

				Search, analyze and catalogue diverse data and create custom dashboards
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>A network of online data libraries accessed through an interactive tool that allows users to perform a multitude of tasks. The tool can generate custom dashboards, using tables, graphs and maps to create an interactive, web-based "HotReport." These reports can also be customized to the data subject(s).</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The DataWeb is a data network developed by the Census Bureau that catalogs, integrates and facilitates data analysis, Web site design and creation. It includes statistical data from federal, state and local agencies that provide information on a public access and restricted use basis. TheDataWeb is a system in which the data producer maintains their own data accuracy and currency. It uses open-source software so that the software is sustainable and inexpensively maintained. As a participant in TheDataWeb, you can publish your data to TheDataWeb and, in turn, benefit by providing data to other consumers of data. TheDataWeb also provides a method for including metadata from disparate systems.</p>
<p>Data is accessed by a tool called "DataFerrett." DataFerrett allows users to access TheDataWeb and create custom tables, graphs and maps.</p>
<p>DataFerrett’s dashboard feature, called "HotReport", allows users to access the power of both TheDataWeb and DataFerrett to easily create interactive Web pages that focus on topics relevant to the user. An example of a customized HotReport is the Community Economic Development (CED) HotReport, found here:</p>
<a href="http://ced.census.gov/"><u>http://ced.census.gov</u></a> . This report was a collaborative project sponsored by the Employment and Training Administration, US Census Bureau, and the Economic Development Administration. Users are able to search for information by states and county or by one of the 39 Employment &amp; Training Administration's WIRED regions. For areas that experience economic disruptions due to natural disasters, plant closings, base closings, and other economic changes, including abrupt increases in employment, the HotReport shows the pertinent economic indicators in concise, online reports. This is just one example of the multitude or HotReports that can be created.

				SOA: A middleware strategy for transparency
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The term SOA, or Service Oriented Architecture has been around for many years. Many organizations are moving towards SOA, while some have implemented a SOA methodology and are reaping the rewards. Let's look at how recovery.gov could implement SOA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The web interface for recovery.gov should leverage portal and web 2.0 technologies. This will allow constituents, agencies and partners to share information, submit requests and disseminate all kinds of rich graphics and data as required for transparency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next layer consists of BPM, Business Process Modeling, to allow requests for data, reports and inquires to have a structured and process oriented flow and execution within the system. BPM is well suited for human work flow requests and clean interaction with the above and below layers of the architecture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ESB, Enterprise Service Bus, provides request routing, service mediation and transformation between the various requestors. This is heart of the messaging system and should be flexible to accommodate various message formats and messaging protocols.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A BPEL, Business Process Execution Language, process execution layer drives the system to system requirements within a standard framework and can be called using standard web services. This allows interaction with source systems via adapters or other interfaces as need to complete the required process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A connectivity layer provides a transparent interface to source systems and relied upon for message formats between the source system and the layer above(BPEL), via XML. This could also include passive data integration via an ETL tool to create data stores for data ingestion and dissemination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally the need for security to support both data at rest and data in motion is required. This should be viewed as a service model called upon by all layers in the architecture. For data in motion, services would include authentication, authorization, auditing , role mapping, entitlements to name just a few. For data at rest, secure backup capabilities, encryption, data masking for sensitive data should be utilized within the&nbsp; database layer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, a management framework allows for system administrators to maintain a 24X7X365 enterprise system. Remember, this will be accessed from around the world. The US will be the looked upon as the leader in systems architecture.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>	
			The foundation for introducing new and exciting features requires a complete comprehensive SOA architecture. This will create flexibility, agility and rapid adoption of new services for everyone in the US and around the world.

<h1>
				Middleware SOA REST Framework for Data 
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Implement a middleware framework that enables information
consumers to gain easy access to a variety of information sources under common
and standardized formats.&nbsp; By placing a
re-usable SOA (Services Oriented Architecture) framework on top of traditional
relational data, flat files, &nbsp;and or
hierarchically structures, the complexities of data silos and multiple formats
are eliminated.&nbsp; By layering a framework between
data sources and the web, information seekers can create easily create web
accessible interfaces that mix and match information across and within information
domains. &nbsp;&nbsp;Using this approach and with
minimal effort , data can be applied to web 2.0 and “Mash-up” &nbsp;applications, including automatic delivery of subscribed
&nbsp;feeds in &nbsp;formats such as XML, RSS, Atom, thus
increasing&nbsp; Recovery.Gov's &nbsp;ability to get&nbsp;
the right information out to the right constituents using&nbsp; a low cost and highly efficient &nbsp;web delivery model.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Recovery.Gov will need to collect, maintain and deliver large
amounts of data and transform this data into consumable and actionable
information.&nbsp; This can be a very difficult
and expensive task, since most organizations have data in a variety of formats
and access methods. The importance of this idea is linked to driving a
re-usable web services information delivery model. &nbsp;&nbsp;Through information architecture patterns
such as REST “Representational State Transfer” Recovery.Gov’s information could
be made accessible to the web, and support read once, and publish many model.
&nbsp;This idea will help Recovery.Gov provide
low cost capabilities that offer quick access to data including turning it into
information streams that can be easily added to web sites across the entire World
Wide Web. &nbsp;Our team has implemented this
type of framework and it provides great business value and information access
across our many business domains.</p>

<p>While I agree with the approach I disagree with the toolset. What is needed is the most heterogeneous platform agnostic solution available. You can and should build this SOA solution using tools from a company that isn't motivated to sell databases, applications, specific application servers, hardware, or services. IBM sells all of these.</p>

				Intuitive and Effective Search 
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Any tool for public use should be intuitive, respond to manipulation in real time and leave users feeling fully informed with knowledge in hand. Too many websites, government or otherwise, achieve only one or even none of these goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most glaring current omission on the Recovery.gov site is an intuitive and effective tool to search the data that is already there. The problem of searching Recovery.gov will become increasingly complex as the site grows over time. Users will want to do more than simply find a document with a keyword, especially in a collection with many pieces of similar data where a single keyword will be repeated in thousands of documents. The search must go beyond keywords&nbsp; – grouping and sorting data within search results and using conceptual search techniques to focus in on the user’s primary objective should be of primary importance.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Without an effective search tool for Recovery.gov, other tools for visualizing and analyzing data like mapping and graphing tools are useless. But the ability to compare and analyze similar pieces of data visually will be a primary need for users: not just one to one comparisons of data, but across time and location, across funded organizations, and type of projects being funded. And users will want it all – need it – at a glance. The most important step towards creating those tools is effective search.</p>

<h1>
				consistency and uniformity in data collection and presentation
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>			
			&nbsp;
	
	Presented below are a few of the
findings from our own research across Recovery.org and various
corresponding state sites:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Requirements for Federal
Agencies</strong></p>
<ul><li>Major Communications. Beginning
immediately, agencies receiving Recovery Act funds should determine
which major communications are appropriate for posting on
Recovery.gov. (see Section 2.2 and Appendix 1 for required data
fields and reporting instructions) 
</li><li>Formula Block Grant Allocation Reports.
As soon as information becomes available, Federal agencies are
required to provide details on the allocations made for each formula
block grant. (see Section 2.3 and Appendix 1 for required data fields
and reporting instructions) 
</li><li>Weekly Updates. Starting March 3rd,
agencies must submit weekly reports providing a breakdown of funding,
major actions taken to date, and major planned actions. (see Section 
2.4 and Appendix 1 for required data fields and reporting
instructions) 
</li></ul>
<p>Agencies initially followed the format
suggested in the Memo dated 2/18/09 detailing the reporting
requirements. Several agencies have begun to format their recovery
sites differently, making it difficult to find the reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the weekly update to
Recovery.gov is not happening on time. Recovery.gov has consistently
been at least a week behind.  While the major agencies have current
data on their respective recovery site, the data is often delayed in
being consolidated to Recovery.gov.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reporting by States</strong></p>
-<em>Inconsistent format for data
categories. i.e. Health Care, Transportation, Education, etc. 
</em>
<ul><li>Inconsistent presentation of data</li><li>Some use graphs</li><li>Some are text only</li><li>Some do not show the funding amount</li><li>Some do not provide lower level
details</li><li>Some sites link to Commercial pages
with ads, etc (Texas)</li><li>Some states use interactive maps, (MD)
 
</li><li>Titling: some use Recovery Act, some
the full title American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)</li></ul>
<em>-Inconsistent downloadable data/material</em>
<ul><li>Some states provide downloadable
reports (VT), others do not [XLS or PDF]</li><li>Data contained in the reports varies
from state to state</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>-Some states list the impact of the
recovery act actions, others do not. [New Mexico for example]</em></p>
<p><em>-Some states list job opportunities,
others do not</em></p>
<p><em>-Information on localities within the
states varies widely</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gathering the essential data elements
to support open transparency is challenged by a lack of data
standardizations and/or appropriate technology at the state and local
levels to support gathering data.  Paramount to this effort is
establishing a mechanism for data aggregation that can support which
represent a lion share of the</p>
<p>The concept of globalizing a process or
mandating technological compliance can seem daunting.  A recommended
approach is to design a ubiquitous open framework that can support
system to system or public to system communication.  Achieving this
objective does not require a monolithic solution comprised of
business process re-engineering, or massive change management
strategies.  A targeted, focused effort at the point of data
acquisition leveraging industry standards such as OWL or Semantic Web
and implementing appropriate COTS products can dramatically reduce
costs.  The objective of the proposal is to develop a solution that
can support all facets of public and private organizations by
establishing an open web site for supplying data associated to
original block grant funding, as well as a comprehensive suite of
services via SOA to support system interoperability while remaining
technology agnostic.  This proposal reduces change costs, can be
quickly adopted and provides a scalable framework that can evolve
through time.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p align="justify">One of the largest
roadblocks facing the objectives of transparency is the inability to
trace Federal Block Grant's to the state and local jurisdictions. 
The goals of transparent government include identifying at a granular
level where and how Federal funding is being utilized.  The major
challenge is a lack of clear standardization with respect to
traceability of funding to the lower elements.</p>

<p>This is another very good suggestion to the Recovery
Dialog. These “50,000 foot” views may definitely reveal the unexpected, and may
ultimately serve as parallel tools to drill down to specific data. Another
advantage of such a fractal approach may the ease by which numbers may be mixed
with literate content (content that is both source and commentary). For example,
the actual budgetary amounts, media commentary, the legislation itself, and
comments from citizens can all be poured into such a non-typical application to
build a single view. In itself this may not say a great deal, but through
comparison it would be very informative.</p>

<p>Web 2.0 in this sense means using XML to expose data structures, file formats, and services such as feeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Web 3.0 means going further to expose and link the concepts and relationships found in data structures, file formats, documents, and web pages using semantic web and natural language technologies.</p>
<p><strong>RECOVERY.GOV</strong></p>
<p>Tracking, making sense, and assessing the stimulus program requires other kinds of data that provided today in recovery.gov.</p>
<p>The Obama administration values&nbsp;openness, transparency, collaboration, and connected governance. This is a big topic, especially given the scale of the Federal government (the scope of policy, information, and services that it deals with) and the number of individual citizens, media and social media, private companies, non-profit organizations, localities, states and regional organizations involved in one way or another with the stimulus program.</p>
<p>The Recovery.gov site is intended to enable people (citizens, investigative journalists, interest groups, government employees, … anyone) to find out how recovery funds are being spent and what we are getting for their money. Today, information being reported by agencies is limited. It encompasses the program areas authorized, and the funds obligated by the agency. But, not how the money is being used, and what is being accomplished with the funds.</p>
<p>So, this is not enough information to enable us to know whether any part of the stimulus program is working. We need to link obligation data from agencies with other sources that will enable us to track who is actually spending the money, where they are spending it, what they are spending it on, how they are spending it, and most importantly, what measurable results we are able to see coming from the monies spent. Where does this data come from?&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will come from Recovery.gov, but much more will come from sources outside of the recovery.gov spreadsheets. So, we need ways to connect information from disparate sources together, if we are going to follow the money from authorized program to use of funds to reported result.</p>
<p>Also, to investigate and analyze recovery initiatives, we need data that allows citizens to go deeper than mere surface reports. Creating 200 jobs in a town of 100 people would be suspicious. Creating 200 jobs in a locality that needs 2 million would be insignificant, hence a failure. We need to see recovery programs, spending, and accomplishments in the context of local statistical data and demographics. Sources of local information will be important in assessing the performance of specific projects. Data that enables citizens to gauge whether funds are being wasted or used fraudulently will come from varied public and private sources, e.g., internet social media, news feeds. We need transparency all the way into each specific project, and across its life cycle.</p>
<p>The idea is to take a “data.gov approach to recovery.gov” and to implement it using Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 techniques. Web 2.0 in this sense means using XML to expose data structures, file formats, and services such as feeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Web 3.0 means going further to expose and link the concepts and relationships found in data structures, file formats, documents, and web pages using semantic web and natural language technologies.</p>
<p>For additional background on the role of cloud computing, web 2.0 and web 2.0 semantic technologies in implementing Obama administration themes of transparent, open, and collaborative e-governance, see the following presentation:</p>
<p><strong>DATA.GOV</strong></p>
<p>The Data.gov site is intended to provide a one-stop location where citizens (and their machines) can gain access to public information in a usable form. For data.gov to function, data providers need to expose five key categories on information that make transparency and accessibility operational for both people and machines, namely:</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data set -- can be uploaded or remote</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tagging or metadata about the data giving the structure of the data, provenance, etc.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;definitions of what this metadata means (concepts, relationships, assertions, etc.), also "domain knowledge" explaining how to interpret it.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;API or web services method of accessing the data, preferably REST-ful</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URL where the data can be accessed.</p>
<p>The data for data.gov is to be selected and provided by all 25 agencies and 125 programs.&nbsp;The basic idea, in its simplest form, is to expose tables of information using XLM and provisioning data sets to the public using&nbsp;&nbsp;RSS feeds. The back-end concept is under discussion. One view is that agencies should expose data in some standard format that would be ported to some form of data.gov warehouse where it is made available through services. Another concept is that agencies should select from data they already make available on their websites, and provide a web services interface to enable data.gov to crawl the site and harvest the information needed. Trade-offs either way. Personally, I favor making fewer demands on agencies and handling conversion and interpretation issues as part of data.gov's value add.</p>
<p><strong><em>Metadata, Tags &amp; Semantics.</em></strong></p>
<p>To create&nbsp;mash-ups&nbsp;through data.gov or any aggregation vehicle, we have to know something about the data structure and what the data names (or column headings, or stubs, etc.) mean. &nbsp;For example, to answer a recovery.gov query I may need two or more spread sheets containing different information from different sources. I want to build a composite that combines some information from each of them. Sure, I can always rebuild the spreadsheet by hand using Excel. Hand-building is tedious because excel knows nothing about what any of the column heads mean. But, what if I could expose the structure of the spreadsheet so that the computer software could interpret that the column heading was the name of a property, and the cells beneath were instances of this, etc. Then, assuming I've been careful about how I named columns etc. I'd have a semi-automated way to build composite spreadsheets. That’s what semantic web technologies give me.</p>
<p>Returning to recovery.gov, it gets more complicated if I want to combine (in some way) tables created by different people at different times using different data definitions. Even more complex if I want to map and link content from different spreadsheets, files, documents, web pages, etc. together. In the past we’ve always done this mapping one-off, by hand, with the results embedded in a particular solutions and not readily re-usable.</p>
<p>To map or mash-up different data sources and services, I have a meta data problem to resolve. What did person X mean by data field Y? Is the value presented in spreadsheet #1, for example a measurement of something over some time period,&nbsp;computed in a way that is compatible with other values that are presented in spreadsheet #2? &nbsp;Also, what do I know about the provenance and quality or integrity of the data in either table? When people resolve these questions, they draw on additional information about the data, as well as some knowledge about the domain in which the data is used. Typically, we find definitions written out in documents or on web pages, or we call someone who knows what the data names and data structures mean.</p>
<p>What if we would like to have an automated or semi-automated way to speed up and simplify the process of combining or mashing-up data? Then, the computer software needs to access and interpret more information than just the data set plus the data names.&nbsp;That is, if we want the computer to be able to help us to interpret, align, and link information from different sources, then we need to express the semantics of this metadata in a way that is machine computable.</p>
<p>What about natural language, and content structures other than tables? In addition, programs that extract information and concepts from natural language (or other sources) can apply the RSS strategy to communicate concepts and instances. This assumes that the classes of information being communicated are known, or otherwise discoverable, by the entity receiving the RSS feed. Typically, the number of classes is restricted, for example, to people, places, organizations, events. Also, when relationships are extracted, then the categories of these are restricted.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Linked Data</em></strong></p>
<p>Linked data is powerful idea that has gained a growing following. Linked data calls for&nbsp;expressing structures, tags, and metadata as RDFa / xhtml, which provides a pretty robust way move the metadata around.&nbsp;Semantic web technologies provide a standard way to express both the data (or document, or page) and the meta information about the concepts and relationships of the data set, which can then be processed and transformed externally in various ways not only to change formatting, but also to map, align and harmonize alternative meanings of terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>RSS feeds can communicate the structure of information, together with the content or instances of it. Typically this is applied to tables of data, forms, and simple document structures. Conceivably, it could be extended to schemas of graphics as well. It is the responsibility of the recipient of the RSS feed to know what the tags and structure of information mean.</p>
<p>A precursor of current thinking about data.gov was a program that the DC government established to provide RSS feeds for a number of data sets that could be used to create&nbsp;mash-ups&nbsp;and composite services. There was even a contest for putting together interesting&nbsp;mash-ups, widgets etc. that produced a number of cool services, and at zero cost to the government. The data.gov initiative will likely feature contests.</p>
<p><strong><em>Semantic publishing.</em></strong></p>
<p>Semantic publishing means sharing both the human readable, and the machine interpretable forms of information. In addition to tables of structured data, present the data structure and data element definitions and metadata in both human and machine-readable forms. Key ideas here include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the concepts of "public information"&nbsp;cover a lot more kinds of content than structured data tables, for example, all of the human-readable content published through government web sites, document collections, published reports, and much, much more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the "publishing" concept carries with it the implication that this body of information has been subject to editing for understanding by people as well some "quality standard" of&nbsp;consistency, accuracy, and credibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the "semantic" aspect of the publishing means that all associated contents -- text, tables, graphics, images, etc. -- come with their structure and metadata expressed digitally (using semantic web, ontology, or other standard) so that any content in the publication can be machine processed as well as read by humans.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, important government data aggregations and document collections already exist that combine multiple sources, have well formulated methodologies, have checked their facts, are well curated, and supported etc. These make logical building blocks for open public information that is trustworthy, accessible by concepts, and accessible in an internet friendly way.</p>
While it is always a good idea to start simply and get some early successes, it is also important to look ahead so as not to get boxed in.&nbsp;There is plenty of value from exposing the structure of tables together with the data they contain using RSS. But, this approach will encounter limitations as the data.gov site scales to more and data&nbsp;sets from more sources, as well as sources of higher knowledge content, etc. For data.gov to succeed, we will need to share knowledge about the data and domain in forms that both humans and machines can interpret. This will include incorporating terminology references and techniques for disambiguating the senses of natural language used to identify and define data concepts, provenance, and trust. This requires a form of syndication that is inclusive of ontology (definitions) and natural language understanding.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Meeting the goals of recovery.gov requires methods that&nbsp;accommodate&nbsp;more data formats, sources, concepts and relationships than will be expressed in spreadsheets posted by agencies. The challenge is to make it easier for citizens, journalists, public interest organizations, government personnel and others to find, connect, analyze,&nbsp;the data and sources needed&nbsp;and present results in ways that communicate effectively. &nbsp;This means providing sharable means to expose the structure, concepts and data from many sources. For tables of information and structured forms, etc. this is doable today with either XML or semantic web technologies. However, as the numbers of data sets grows, the complexity of the information represented increases, and (in some cases) the structure of this information evolves, then we need to adopt semantic technology based approaches that can handle the scale, and simplify the combining of information.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The use of computerized accounting systems has been around for some time and industry has slowly come around to implementing these new capabilities; a central system of services such as SaaS would make it possible for industry, companies, government and individuals to take advantage of these systems and be able to share common indicators of how well they are doing financially.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everyone who uses computers has relied on developing their own solutions instead of using commercial available off-the-shelf solutions, let alone SaaS&nbsp;solutions,&nbsp;that they can use and also share data that indicates how-well they are doing financially over a period of time. It is true that SaaS in a new concept but it can be a type of solution that will give the type of feedback we need to do an effective job of monitoring financial data in real time. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Data analysis can be a successful way to processing information collected to determine if the limits have been exceeded both high and low. A real plus sign is when we can take that process to a point where we can realize, as you say, real indicators of how well we are doing as well as project problem areas or cycles where events might be expected, such as rough times for financial institutions and individuals. We can also flag indicators that make the situation worse, such as the credit card industry reactions.</p>

				Improve display &amp; visualization of info from this web site
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The usefulness of this web site could be increased by improving the way in which users can navigate ideas and the system displays information.&nbsp; In particular, it would be helpful to be able to see more ideas displayed at a given time, in response to a given query or topic, than the format now, which now displays hits in non-compact form, with maybe only 4 or 5 hits per page.&nbsp; I'd suggest offering an additional format that uses only one or two lines per hit, and gives the user the option of how many hits to include per page.&nbsp; This will enable users to get better, more comprehensive views of information, and find items of interest faster.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Current method of display shows only 4 or 5 hits per page, which then requires tabbing through many pages of results if a given search produces many results.&nbsp; You could easily increase the amount of information displayed on a screen at one time by eliminating much of the graphic content that is now on the screen, spreading and compressing info on a given hit, and expanding the page being viewed to a large number of lines.&nbsp; This will make the system easier to use and will produce useful information faster.</p>

<p>Definitely need to increase the number of items shown on any page. More ideas than 5 ( hopefully 20 by default and more as an option) need to be displayed per page. Even with that you'd have to look at 20 pages to review them all. Other features that would be nice are email notifications when your comment is answered as well as the comments you were viewing to be displayed when you are writing yours. Right now only the article is displayed when you're writing a comment. Overall, I'm glad to see this sort of site in use by the US Government and hope it will continue to be nurtured and improved.</p>

<p>Do not ask agencies to report too much data in too much complicated format.</p>
<p>Ask them for the most essential data points in the simplest possible data-collection form (even XLS spreadsheet that can be read by computer program). The points to collect:</p>

<p>&nbsp;- Address where project is being executed</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Start date</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Estimated End-date</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Budgeted amount</p>
<p>Then, encourage citizens/residents of that area to take photos/videos and tag them on to the map at the project's location. Encourage them to put a 'date' on each photo.</p>
<p>I am sure the agencies / counties/ cities are already required to report details about every project they undertake. We should not try to use ARRA to&nbsp;</p>

<h1>
				Reporting Waste &amp; Inefficiency should be Easy and Safe
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Recovery.gov should provide an easy <strong>and safe</strong> way for&nbsp;people who want to report waste, fraud &amp; abuse (or just plain inefficiency) with respect to Recovery spending.</p>
<p><strong>As President Obama recently stated</strong>, the people who are closest to the work are the ones most likely to see the waste and inefficiency in that work.</p>
<p>And, with respect to&nbsp;Recovery spending, that means employees of government (federal, state, &amp; local), <em>as well as employees of&nbsp;contractors to government</em>.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>,&nbsp;those employees will not&nbsp;report waste&nbsp;or inefficiency&nbsp;if <strong>(1)</strong>&nbsp;they are unaware or confused about&nbsp;how to&nbsp;report it, or if <strong>(2)</strong> there is&nbsp;a risk that&nbsp;they will <strong>lose their job&nbsp;for making the report.</strong></p>
<p>Yes,&nbsp;the traditional "whistleblower protections" for federal employees are now also&nbsp;extended to contractor employees under the&nbsp;the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ("ARRA").&nbsp; But <em><strong>those "protections" are so weak</strong></em> that only the most naive of federal employees&nbsp;actually believe that they work. &nbsp;(The wise ones have seen what really happens to the "whistleblowers".)</p>
<p>However, now there is technology that Recovery.gov can use that&nbsp;allows a person to report waste or inefficiency AND, at the same time, gives them sufficient&nbsp;confidence that they will not be "found out" by their supervisors.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about the "old"&nbsp;system offered by the govt. IGs or the GAO's Fraudnet, who expect&nbsp;the employee&nbsp;to trust their career to a complete stranger.&nbsp; I'm talking about outside-the-government vendors whose technology&nbsp;(and reputation) offer employees <strong>the level of control and confidentiality needed</strong> before they will "blow the whistle"&nbsp;on their organization.</p>
<p>I don't have a list of these vendors (nor do I work for any of them), but I know that some of them are on the GSA's list of pre-approved vendors (i.e., a federal agency could purchase their services very quickly).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CEO of one of those vendors has a blog-posting about the <a class="external-link" href="http://tinyurl.com/dhxjfq">ARRA's&nbsp;legal requirements for a&nbsp;whistleblowing system </a>needed by public and private organization that receive Recovery funds.&nbsp; Recovery.gov should provide&nbsp;an easy-to-understand "FAQs" on that topic (with links)&nbsp;for the benefit of those employers and employees.</p>
<p>In fact, <strong>it would be a very powerful symbol</strong> if the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB) itself adopted this better-than-legal system for people to report (confidentially or not) opportunities for improvement in the RATB's operations (including&nbsp;Recovery.gov) and not just limit it to&nbsp;a&nbsp;one-time, one-week window (like&nbsp;this platform).</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Any auditor will tell you that the single biggest source for detecting waste, fraud &amp; abuse (in any organization) comes from "tips" and information provided by the employees who see it.</p>
<p>If we make it easy and&nbsp;<strong>and safe</strong> for employees to make those reports, then&nbsp;more of them will do so which, in turn, will be the <strong><em>single biggest deterrent to waste, fraud and abuse</em></strong> (and, yes, just plain inefficiency) in the use of Recovery&nbsp;funds.</p>

<h1>
				Evaluation Helps Us Spend the Dollar Once
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Evaluation is a challenging task under any condition.&nbsp; It involves all kinds of methodologies, both quantitative and qualitative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it is essential and very important, it often scares&nbsp; people and local agencies to death, costs a small fortune and rarely leaves communities with the capacity to do it themselves.</p>
<p>Quantitative data is essential, but doesn't always leave much behind.&nbsp; Also, unless presented in an entertaining way or with a big punch, it might not stick in the public's mind.&nbsp; Collecting dry data can miss the real wins in a program or community.</p>
<p><em><strong>Five Ideas:&nbsp; </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Plan with Results in Mind</strong></em>. Beyond the grant or funding purpose, how else will the community define success.&nbsp; They may not be exactly the same.</p>
<p><em><strong>Count Big and Little Wins</strong></em>.&nbsp; We want to account for unexpected wins, big and small.&nbsp; Results can fly under the scientific radar.&nbsp; Real and sustainable success relies on many variables, not just one or two.&nbsp; Make room for candid community evaluation.</p>
<p><em><strong>Failure Analysis is a Vehicle for Success</strong></em>:&nbsp; Silicon Valley successes are built on a million failures.&nbsp; The same is true of really effective programs.&nbsp; Good evaluation is a tool for continuous improvement not a grading system upon which future funding depends.&nbsp; The evaluation paradigm needs to be updated.</p>
<p><em><strong>Build Community Capacity</strong></em></p>
<p>Everything we do should leave people better off, with more capacity, than before the federal money touched their lives.&nbsp; Ideally we will leave people with more tools and capacity so our investment can be sustained past funding.</p>
<em><strong>Evaluation is a Story</strong></em>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tell the public a story, involve the recipient of funding as a partner.&nbsp; People love stories, big or small.&nbsp; Turning results into a story will capture the public imagination.&nbsp; Past the data, people need to relate to the data.&nbsp; Stories do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used this methodology in evaluating the Advancing Community Policing Grants for COPS/Justice.&nbsp; My partners were local law enforcement agencies.&nbsp; It worked well, was published, shared credit, and the fear factor went way down. This did not cost a lot of money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>The target audience for this idea is the general public and the recipients of funding.</p>
<p>The public wants to know what happened with the money.&nbsp; We are making an investment in the future of the United States.&nbsp; President Obama has promised transparency, accountability and results.</p>
<p>Our job is to find out and explain clearly, what happened with the public dollar.&nbsp; The pubic is a big partner, ideally this money will leave behind sustainable programs and help us get to a place where we spend the public dollar once.</p>
<p>How we tell this story matters a lot, should capture the public imagination, honor different learning styles, and&nbsp; create pride and excitement.</p>
<p>This is more likely to happen if the data is digestable and useful to the American public.&nbsp; Everyone remembers being told stories as a child, adults like it too.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>To require compliance with a program that demonstrates transparency, oversight and accountability by maintaining precise and authentic financial and administrative records for allocating and disbursing funds.</p>
<p>Provide a methodology for a standardized audit and oversight, and ensure that information is ready for future FOIA requests and examinations.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Adherence to <strong>Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles</strong> will result in standardization of documentation as it relates to the appropriation of the funds.</p>
<p>The audit function can be standardized across all entities that receive federal funds leading to clear and transparent interpretation of results.&nbsp; This will enable effective oversight and consistent reporting to the taxpayers of the United States.</p>

<p>I agree. With the recovery money going through state agencies including not for profit organizations trancparency needs to start at the level at which it is granted. With all the programs that are available it is difficult to find the agency that is actually responsible to cary out specific stimulus projects. States need more transparency. State ajendas do not seem to match the Fed ajenda of recovery. In NY, raising taxes is still the norm. Supplemental Health care income levels have decreased significantly. More New Yorkers no longer have access to affordable health care.&nbsp;</p>

				Creating an ARRA Portfolio of Investments
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Project/Portfolio Management is a concept currently accepted throughout much of the&nbsp;Government today.&nbsp; In essence, ARRA is creating the need for a full Project/Portfolio Management capability.&nbsp; A capability that encapsulates a formalized selection process for investments/projects, enables selection based on value to the ARRA goals and objectives, creates a sustainable project/portfolio management capability and culminates with robust reporting and analysis both internally to the government and externally to our citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.projility.com">www.projility.com</a> for more information.&nbsp; Contact us and ask to see our Federal Portfolio Management Solution which is already in use within the Federal Government today.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Transparency and accountability, both common themes we have heard before and are finally beginning to see enforced within Government.&nbsp; ARRA has tremendous potential for good yet is fraught with potential for waste and fraud.&nbsp; To&nbsp;manage this, we have to have insight into the who, what, when, where, why&nbsp;and how.&nbsp; As others have said, "You can't manage what you can't measure".&nbsp; To&nbsp;effectively measure, you need accurate inputs.&nbsp; Accurate&nbsp;inputs come from formalizing processes and procedures.&nbsp; Obtaining these accurate inputs may entail some detailed work Project management &amp; reporting) but what the hey, one should expect a resonable level of effort&nbsp;if you are being provided millions of our tax payers dollars!!</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>Organize data such that it allows for drill down or drill in, starting at the Federal / National level, going to State and local levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Show , as the site does now, dollars available and dollars allocated at these lower levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;For dollars allocated, show the funded projects and initiatives, funding gaps and project progress over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Citizens will want to see</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The projects that are, or will, be funded by the recovery budget plan and where those projects are in the US</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drill downs as to what the specific projects or Initiatives are and what the planned budget for them is, or will be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the project level, show planned complete date and progress to plan as a percentage, for example Project AAA is 10% &nbsp;complete, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Show how many direct and indirect &nbsp;jobs those projects may provide.,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The software tools for this can be rudimentary and using open source products, should be close to free.</p>

<p>Provide a web based input portal for this purpose and require each local or state receiving recovery funds to report, at least monthly, project progress.&nbsp; Every project should have a project manager at the local level, so this should not be a huge burden.</p>

<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>I am one of the owners of Intechs.com (Information Technology
Solutions, Inc.) and a major draw back to innovation in IT is that we
simply aren't using the technologies available. We have just been
contacted about a project that will finally begin to utilize sound
technologies and methodologies to create jobs and put people back to
work. We have noticed that too many IT managers have missed this simple
concept that leads to better, more cost effective solutions for
Information Technology systems.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>IT departments spend way too much money on things they don't need because they are missing this simple concept, but it does require a highly skilled IT staff, that understands these concepts and how to implement them.</p>

<p>We are sure that if OMB gets behind a program, such as VUE-IT, it has got to be a great step to automate data and information collection in the federal community especially the IT (information technology) arena. GSA and the 27 agencies will be able to share this massive amount of data in their data collection platform. What about all the systems out there that are administrative and mission oriented; do they also get plugged in and what real decisions can be made to make them cost effective and compliant with the federal standards and management regulations that OMB leads the way through the FAR. What can this system share with the industry and individuals for monitoring financial successes? I am sure if government can make it work for them, the benefits&nbsp;would be great for all to share.</p>

<p>There should be some agreement on the time series to be used in modeling the effectiveness of the stimulus package.&nbsp; Obviously some measure of job creation by industry and region would be desirable.&nbsp; We should also strive to identify which variables are endogenous and which are exogenous.&nbsp; The formulation of testable hypotheses is also very desirable.</p>

<p>It would be nice to use a database like FRED as the St. Louis Federal Reserve to collect relevant metrics with which to model the effectiveness of the stimulus package.&nbsp; Many of us already use this database for various econometric models and find it to be reasonably well maintained.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is often lacking the regional, temporal or industry specific granularity that we would like to have, but it is a good starting point and provides tools one can use to import the relevant time series into sophisticated statistical packages for time series analysis, intervention analysis, causality testing, etc.&nbsp; Every effort should be made to collect data at the highest possible frequency.&nbsp; Weekly would be ideal, but monthly observations would be adequate and make seasonal adjustment easier.</p>

<h1>
				Adopt Effective IT Complexity Management
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>All Federal IT projects should adopt a formal mechanism for managing the complexity of new IT projects.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>66% of all Federal IT dollars are invested in high risk projects, that is, projects that are likely to fail. This number has been steadily increasing. It was 30% in 2007, 43% in 2008. At the current rate of increase, by the year 2010 this number will be close to 100%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only is IT failure a huge cost to the Federal budget ($47 billion, in 2009), but there is an even larger cost to the US economy as a whole. For every dollar in direct cost, there is at least another five dollars in indirect costs. The actual costs to the US economy are therefore in the neighborhood of $300 billion dollars per year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason that so many Federal IT projects are at high risk is that there is no effective IT complexity management strategy. The complexity of the systems being build is increasing and the tools for project management have not kept pace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complexity is exponentially related to functionality. That means that as the functionality of an IT system increases, its complexity increases much faster. And both system cost and system risk go up with complexity, so small additions of functionality can increase the risk of failure dramatically especially as the system approaches the breaking point, as most Federal IT systems have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer to this is a Federally mandated program to train IT managers in understanding how complexity impacts IT systems and developing effective processes for managing and mitigating IT complexity. Not only would such a program greatly reduce the failure risk of Federal IT systems, it would also reduce their cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, the answer to IT complexity is found in partitioning IT systems based on synergies between functionality. Applying this concept to a large IT system can reduce the overall complexity, cost, and risk of system failure by at least 75%. If this approach is applied across the entire spectrum of Federal IT, we can expect to reduce the cost of Federal IT from today’s $71 billion per year to around $35 billion per year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only will we reduce the cost, but we will see a dramatic improvement in the number of systems that are actually delivered. We will also see an marked improvement in the quality of those systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This program is a win-win strategy. We save money at the same time as we improve government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on the nature of complexity in Federal IT systems, see the editorial in the Perspectives of the International Association of Software Architects available at http://www.objectwatch.com/white_papers.htm#EditorialIASA</p>

<p>The idea is solution to comment below if valid. More jobs should be made known on a stimulus data base, and outreached directly via touchpoints advertised by the government, not only for government jobs, how about the contractor companies getting involved, they get government funding, but little transparency about positions.

<p>While Main Street is encountering jobless rates, Washingtonites are given preferential treatment???? Are any of these jobs doable from locations out of DC area, like telecommuting???</p>

Former Bush administration staffers are feeling the economic pinch as acutely as other victims of the sagging economy, Politico reports. GOP job-seekers in Washington face a triple whammy of economic chaos, minority status on Capitol Hill, and an excess of qualified Republicans. “The Washington side is a bit of a black hole because there are so many people with so much experience looking and the economy’s so tight,” said one 14-year DC veteran. <strong>Even though only about one-fifth of open positions are publicly posted, </strong>congressional offices are receiving hundreds of resumes, and former paid staffers are taking volunteer internships just to stay on the Hill. “I planned for the worst, and it was worse than I thought,” one former Agriculture Department official said. "It’s like having a horrible disease," says one job-seeker. "You have good days, and you have bad days

				How to Improve the Value of Recovery.gov Data
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p>The Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board should work with the Federal Chief Financial Officer’s (CFO) Council and industry to develop guidance for agencies in securing Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) financial management platforms to manage the financial data submitted to Recovery.gov.&nbsp; This guidance should encourage agencies to purchase Information Technology (IT) solutions that easily integrate with existing systems, and enable agencies to view financial data at the macro- and micro-levels (e.g., project code, organization, by vendor, etc.).&nbsp; In addition, this guidance should recommend that these solutions are scalable and facilitate agency use of financial management data for improved performance management, project management, and capital planning.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Providing transparency and accountability into the use of American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) funds is essential.&nbsp; Just as important, however, is making sure that agencies reap the benefits of this data to improve planning and financial management.&nbsp; Without the capability to view and analyze this data, reporting to Recovery.gov runs the risk of becoming simply another government data call. &nbsp;Unfortunately, many agencies rely on a complex system of Excel spreadsheets and/or homegrown IT systems to manage their financial data.&nbsp; The result is that these agencies are unable to fully analyze ARRA – and other agency data – over the long-term to make better business decisions that link program, organization, and agency investments with performance metrics and mission success.&nbsp; With guidance from the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, the CFO Council, and industry, agencies will see purchasing financial management IT solutions as an Administration priority and act on it, ultimately improving the value of Recovery.gov data and the effectiveness of government.</p>

<p>A FOIA request seeking the disclosure of government contractors performance scores to be decided by DoD soon under new Obama "transparency" policy. Previously, the Bush Administration bureaucracy stopped disclosure due to the potential embarrassment of poor performing contractors who continue to receive major government contracts, particularly involving Iraq. The rating scores track contractor’s performance and provide a record, both positive and negative, on a given contract during a specific period of time. Similar performance rating systems, are used by state governments and openly made available to the public. This FOIA request is directly challenging the "old guard" mentality of the government contracts establishment that is often shielded from public scrutiny.

<p>The problem with most of the ideas presented so far that I read<br />through about the data and access seems to be same as governments<br />general problem in general. Centralization, proprietor formats,<br />and limiting access. It would seem that the data no matter what<br />organization it comes from could be standardized, after all you<br />really want to know is how much money, which areas is the money<br />to be used in and then finally a timeline with updates of the<br />expenditures and to who. So:<br /><br />1. Create the standardized characteristic of the data fields.<br /><br />2. Use the existing structure of the internet to store and allow<br />&nbsp;  access to the data.<br /><br />&nbsp;  To do this just go use Amazon's cloud or other similar entity<br />&nbsp;  and setup a Linux image with a postgreSQL or MySQL database that<br />&nbsp;  defines the data using the standard. There is going to be some<br />&nbsp;  fee here for bandwidth, but you don't have to pay to use the<br />&nbsp;  Linux OS or open source database.<br /><br />3. Let users have access to it. People will come up with the ways<br />&nbsp;  to analyze and follow up on the government expenditures to track.<br /><br />&nbsp;  Take myself for example, if you give me access to the database<br />&nbsp;  I can use tools like my MyJSQLView tool or Weka to analyze the<br />&nbsp;  data. These tools which are open source don't cost anything and<br />&nbsp;  allow data to be accessed and analyzed. Again no cost.<br /><br />If the approach is to be open and stimulating to the economy then<br />let as many people as possible access the data. Going to a central<br />web page with a limited interface and access does not do that. Just<br />put the data up on the Internet in a cluster that is scalable with<br />standard characterstic fields on an open source database and let<br />people have access to it with free tools that are already available.<br />Information is then decentralization, no proprietor formats, and<br />unlimited access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Limits costs, decentralized the information and allows unlimited access to the data.</p>

<p>Great points all. Those of us who will mash this stuff up already know the tools we'll use and they're free to download, use, modify, and redistribute. I have a server running Linux, MySQL, and Apache that's ready to play. All we lack is the data...</p>

			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>Use rich internet application technology like silverlight / WPF / Flash to improve the data visualization like Map(GIS) base drill down, category or department based drill down along with multiple graphs / charts to provide an intuitive insight about the huge amount of data published regularly by the web sites.</p>
</div>
</span></p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Data visualization is very important whenever insight is required from huge amounts of data. If regular people are not able to find the right insight from the data provided, it won't be useful in finding the inefficiencies in the process / project. I think it'll make huge differrence if more people are able to derive insight from the data and able to understand and compare the data to report the inconsistancies in the spending and implementations of the project.</p>

				Low Cost Subscription Application tracks Stimulus Projects
			</h1>
<span class="type-idea">idea</span>
<h2>What is the idea?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>ActiveStrategy StimulusScorecard™ –
available on the GSA schedule for the federal government – is a low-cost,
turn-key web-based service designed to allow recipients and subrecipients of
funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA or Recovery
Act) to effectively and proactively monitor and manage their projects and
programs. <br />
<br />
ActiveStrategy StimulusScorecard collects the project information required by
the ARRA and makes real-time data available so governments can identify the
preemptive action needed to prevent delays, waste, fraud, and abuse that could
undermine program performance and public confidence. Simply put, it is a
service that allows governments to monitor, manage, review, and report on all
stimulus programs and projects from one location. <br />
<br />
</p>
<p><a class="external-link" href="http://forms.activestrategy.com/go/activestrategy/nationaldialogue_stimulus_webinar">View a demo of the system during the
second half of this recording.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>StimulusScorecard provides a secure, low-cost system that requires
virtually no IT support and can be online and ready to go in days. The package
includes ActiveStrategy Enterprise online scorecard software, documentation,
training, best practices measurement templates for the ARRA, telephone support,
help selecting key measures and objectives to get your system usable right
away, and ongoing analysis of OMB guidance. Coaching on how to use the system
to conduct reviews of stimulus-funded projects and ARRA strategy is included as
well. There is no software to buy or install – governments and agencies pay for
the system only for as long as it is needed as part of the management and
administrative costs of their stimulus projects.</p>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>ActiveStrategy StimulusScorecard allows
federal agency, state, city, and local officials, as well as other Recovery Act
recipients, to monitor and manage:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>How efficiently and effectively the
     dollars are being spent in real time (i.e. are the programs on-time,
     on-budget, and on-quality from their original plan)</li><li>How much impact there is on economic
     recovery (i.e. what long-term benefits are being realized in job creation
     productivity, energy efficiency, etc.)</li><li>Who is responsible for projects and
     what updates are they providing on performance</li><li>How many projects and how many
     dollars have been awarded, spent, obligated or are pending</li></ul>
